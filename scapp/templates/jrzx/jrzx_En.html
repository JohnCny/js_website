					<h1 class="H1">2013P2P Investor Survey</h1>
					<div class="zz">Author：admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published：2013-11-19 13:26:00</div>
					<div class="xx">
						<p class="step"> 1. P2P investor groups of young men are the main force </p>
						<p> In the P2P investor groups , males accounted for 85% of the male 's risk appetite stronger , more willing to try new things ; 20 years old to 40 years old accounted for the entire group of investors 80% , which is the middle-aged group at work with some savings , but also the main force of China 's Internet users , more receptive to new things internet . </p>
						<p class="step"> 2. Investor is a " Cock wire " group </p>
						<p> Born with roots imprinted Internet , Internet banking is no exception. Bao 1 yuan fiscal balance in the traditional financial institutions seems a myth , but the openness of the Internet and grass-roots make it all a reality. Balance Po 's success is thanks to the long tail , its users are mostly consumer credit is very small, but the number was much , many small companies and individual users to their offers great income. Traditional fund financial household 70000-80000 yuan investment amount , the balance amount of investment per capita treasure users only 2,000 yuan. Although each user only dozens, hundreds of dollars , but the 800 million users of the " long tail " Let the money into a huge sum of money , hundreds of millions of customers to Celestica fund " Caoji become the Phoenix ." P2P industry also has this feature. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2.1 P2P investors are mainly located in the economically developed regions . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2.2 Annual income of less than 100,000 investors accounted for 60% of the annual income of 200,000 or more accounted for only 15%. </p>
						<p> To developed areas to measure the economic level , the majority of investors are lower income " Cock wire " group, they are in front of the threshold of traditional financial institutions , and not much financial opportunities. Several hundred dollars you can invest P2P industry for the " Cock wire ' groups to provide a realistic investment options. Net loan investment low starting point is a big advantage. Of course, there are also investors in the P2P " rich handsome ", there is an investor only in the event of network failures to win the world , there are several million quilt. </p>
						<p class="step"> 3. Investor " obsession " in P2P </p>
						<p> Considerable part of investors to indulge in P2P, spend a lot of time, effort and money in them. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3.1 Investor would spend a lot of effort to research industry </p>
						<p> P2P is an emerging industry , most people are not well understood , but the industry has developed rapidly , the need to keep on learning . 76% of people will spend one hour a day or more time to focus on net loan information . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3.2 Investor " heavily loaded " P2P34% of investors will invest more than 80% to the net loan assets , 55 % of investors will invest more than 50% of assets to net loan industry . </p>
						<p> " Cock wire " group financial channels is limited, many investors are heavy P2P may also be one important reason . </p>
						<p class="step"> 4. Investors expect higher yields </p>
						<p> Only 3 % of Investors expected annual yield of 18 % or less ; 61% of the investor's expected annual yield of over 24% , which for financing enterprises, the cost still high , but still lower than the civil usury . P2P 's long-term sustainable development requires a balanced and reasonable interest rates. Currently, some of the big brand platform level of interest rates had fallen to 10 percent to 18 percent, becoming more rational ; while some of the new platform in order to attract investors , the annual interest rate is often as high as 30% or even 40 % or more, some investors sided pursuit of high revenue and relax vigilance against risks ( 58% of investors are willing to invest in on-line within a month of the new platform ) . Platform collapses have occurred, and may increase as the number of platforms and the risk of accumulation of more and more frequent , in which a considerable part is just on the line of the new platform. Choose the platform when investors should try to maintain a rational , risk control. </p>
						<p class="step"> 5. Investors to gain considerable </p>
						<p> Many P2P investor " obsession " in P2P, a more reasonable explanation is that we invest in P2P tasted the sweetness . Indeed the findings : 94 % of investors in the P2P industry was a positive return , in which a person gains more than 87% of 18%. </p>
						<p> P2P is one of the few people or even the only way to wealth , and indeed make money , so everyone fond of P2P . This is similar with the balance of treasure , many users see a real harvest, will be attracted for more input . The balance of the funds to invest in precious Monetary Fund , with less risk , but also low income ( annual yield of about 4% ) ; Generally speaking , the risk of investing in P2P compared to investing in the balance of treasure to be much larger , but the benefits is also much higher. Both have in common is the benefit of the " Cock wire " group . </p>
						<p> From an investor point of view of the actual investment income , P2P investment risk does not seem large , the vast majority of investors are given a positive return , and higher yields . In fact, this is a platform to provide security for the background conditions , the risk assumed by the platform first , the risks faced by investors is greatly weakened. </p>
						<p class="step"> 6. Investors value the ability to control the wind platform </p>
						<p> P2P is an emerging industry, the lack of supervision , platforms of varying quality in the context of a very high value platform investor risk control ability and means. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 6.1 Platform for investors to consider a strength , the most important is the ability to control the wind platform . </p>
						<p> Wind control is the core competence of financial institutions in the field of P2P is no exception. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 6.2 Platform for investors view risk control ability , the most valued users have mortgage borrowers . </p>
						<p>Even in the field of P2P , mortgage has become the first means of risk control . Many platforms will do more the beginning of the pure credit loans business, but in the harsh environment of credit , credit loans bad debt rate is higher, a great loss , had more towards the mortgage business. Credit environmental differences , resulting in a different foreign P2P mode . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 6.3 In the absence of commitment investors are not willing to invest in advanced platforms </p>
						<p> Platform advance mode , to a great extent, protect the interests of investors , making the P2P industry to further develop . But the risk is concentrated in advance of the platform , the platform is more difficult to profit . With 94% of the investor profits to the contrary , the current P2P platform rarely profitable , most platforms are losses . In order to create security mode Hongling venture capital , for example, in recent years, the cumulative advance of its tens of millions , a lot of profit erosion , making the business profitable in the P2P platform is not much . </p>
						<p> Emergence of this situation is the Chinese credit environment of the decision, Chinese P2P platform saddled with greater risks than their foreign counterparts , must constantly control means in the wind , and business model innovation, in order to survive and develop . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 6.4 Polydispersity investors investing </p>
						<p> Vast majority of investors do not regard their eggs in one basket, they will invest to reduce risk through diversification . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 6.5 Investors perceive risk of the sides </p>
						<p> While investors are concerned about the risk, but in the actual process of investment in the face of temptation of high-yield new platform , we are often willing to take the plunge . </p>
						<p class="step"> 7. Investors optimistic about prospects for the development of P2P </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 7.1 38% of investors in 2012 to enter the P2P industry ; 41% of investors in 2013 to enter the P2P industry . Two years into the P2P industry investors far ahead a few years . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 7.2 Investors have more confidence in prospects of the industry </p>
						<p> In the financial sector , confidence is crucial . This self-regulation in the P2P industry , confidence is more important. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 7.3 Platform collapse phenomenon did not dampen the enthusiasm of investors </p>
						<p> Although 27% of people had to bear the investment losses, but only 6 % of investors said they would reduce the net loan amount of investment . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 7.4 Investors will increase net loan amount invested </p>
						<p> 68% of investors said to increase the net loan amount invested , net loan investment is still the first choice for this group of investment channels. </p>
						<p class="step"> 8.P2P help alleviate the small micro-enterprise financing </p>
						<p> Investors to invest in financing projects operating preferences very obvious, and P2P platform for financing companies , mostly small and micro enterprises , so it is conducive to small and micro enterprises P2P industry solutions for the problem of financing . </p>
						<p> In practice , business financing is the lowest default rate , which is consistent with investor risk control requirements. </p>
						<p> Small micro-enterprise financing difficult problem of the world , especially in China . Because formal financial institutions financing channels , China 's small and micro enterprises mainly rely on private finance long to get the funds needed for development . But private financial or confined between acquaintances , volume is limited, either very high interest costs , which is not conducive to private financial health, healthy development , is not conducive to the financing of small and micro enterprises . </p>
						<p> P2P mode is the private financial sunshine , standardization , specialization, large-scale development of an attempt , and has achieved some success. Some P2P platform began to carry out supply chain finance services for the shareholders or partners upstream and downstream enterprises to provide financing services , can effectively control the risk ( lower interest rates ) but also to expand their business scale ; others try to equity plus debt platform approach for the small and micro enterprises to provide comprehensive financial services. I believe that with more and more powerful companies to enter the field of P2P , P2P will provide small and micro enterprises to provide more professional, more flexible, more cost- financing services. </p>
						<p class="step"> 9. Big platform in the investor 's word of mouth has appeared </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 9.1 No supervision, no threshold in the case , investors are more dependent on word of mouth and the boss 's personal circumstances to evaluate a platform 's strength and credibility. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 9.2 Large platform of the brand has a strong lead </p>
						<p> Best platform for evaluation, Hongling venture capital , loans and land gold in all three got the 45% of the vote, far ahead of other platforms . </p>
						<p> Worth noting that domestic early, high-profile pat loans received only 1% of the votes , it may be because their business model has not been accepted ( 87% investors will not invest in non- advanced platform ) . </p>
						<p> Large platform trusted by investors , liquidity , and thus able to maintain a reasonable level of interest rates ( annualized interest generally below 20% ) , and thus attract more financing of higher quality project , forming a virtuous circle , is conducive to long-term development platform . </p>
						<p> With several major platforms enhance the brand influence , the new platform for investor awareness and recognition of the difficulty and costs may increase . </p>
						<p class="step"> 10. Investor news and Internet advertising is a major incentive to enter the P2P industry </p>
						<p> 61% of investors through news and internet news attention and eventually into the P2P industry . </p>
						<p> Most investors in 2012 and 2013 into P2P , which is a lot of national media attention and coverage P2P start time , which makes more and more people know this P2P industry ; these two years , but also the rapid increase in the number of platforms for two years , in response to competition and a large number of ads is also an objective played no small role in the promotion . </p>
						<p> Some new platforms blindly through high interest rates to attract investors , on the one hand to bring their own great cost , on the other hand is not conducive to the healthy development of the whole industry . In doing market development and other basic work, how better to create a good brand image of a P2P platform facing an important issue. </p>

						<p> The rapid spread of the Internet , smart phones outbreak , the prevalence of social media ...... various factors are intertwined , creating the Internet everyone is , everyone from the media network ecological environment. Pervasive Internet has changed people's consumption patterns, the company's innovative business model , but also spawned the birth of the O2O business model development . </p>
						<p> Large user groups as well as the participation of enterprises in various industries , making O2O usage scenarios rapid expansion. However, the arrival of people O2O cheered when, in practice O2O have encountered various problems : Conversion rate is too low , difficult to balance costs and revenues , some of the characteristics of the industry makes it difficult to penetrate ..... </p>
						<p> However , in any case , O2O billowing wave has come, and unstoppable. </p>
						<p> Past, we go to the cinema viewing site to buy tickets , go to a restaurant to become a guest and then a la carte consumption , live performances lined up to grab the biggest names in the ticket queue up for tickets to the train station ...... these scenes , in today have been or are to become past tense . With the Internet, efficient and convenient channel for the flow of information into the daily operations of the traditional industries , spawned a generation of O2O . The arrival of the wave of mobile Internet , but also to further accelerate the rapid expansion of O2O usage scenarios for the future of blowout O2O laid the foundation environment . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> O2O half water , half fire </p>
						<p> O2O (OnlineToOffline), different from B2C, B2B, C2C e-commerce model in which consumers put online to go to the physical store : Online payment line of goods, services , and then to go on -line access to services . By discount, providing information, service book , etc., the message line stores pushed to Internet users , which will convert them to customers under the line . In this mode , the line services can be used online to Showmanship , consumers can to filter through online services , you can also pay online review. The most important features of the model are: promotion effect to be investigated, each transaction can be tracked. </p>
						<p> O2O achieve traceability of user behavior , measurable , predictable , so that enterprises across time and geographies orders for three high and one low ( high labor costs, high rent, high-tax costs, low profits ) traditional industry to bring a low-cost marketing , operations the new method. </p>
						<p> O2O is essentially a model, that is through the PC Internet, mobile Internet and traditional industries combined , derived more new business models , consumption patterns. In offline this side, you can cover people's daily " eat, drink live with line " aspects. </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/2.png"/>
						<p> Kai-fu Lee once said , O2O will change China , online and offline once all together, will form a huge explosive force. However, for the enterprise, still cautious . Although O2O in China looks beautiful, but the actual implementation is not so easy smug . From time to time under the banner name of glamorous O2O business, website unsustainable , and why ? </p>
						<p> From the industry perspective, the consumer acceptance , the level of IT industry , industry management characteristics and other reasons, the fact O2O applications in different industries , maturity is not the same . Some industries , such as hotels , restaurants , have long realized O2O, and there are success stories. And some industries, such as domestic service , education and training , maintenance services , with its O2O awareness level is not very high , it is still the customer's spending habits established for these industries , O2O is a myth. </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/3.png"/>
						<p> The online side, the Chinese Internet industry, three people TAB (Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu) have been in this field layout of the platform , not to fall behind . Such as Tencent micro- letters , SOSO map ; Ali's high moral map , the U.S. group , Taobao local livelihood ; Baidu launched Baidu map . </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/4.png"/>
						<p> So, in offline this end , O2O situation how ? From the current development of relatively mature O2O catering industry , the hotel industry as evidenced in several case . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> O2O the food and beverage industry </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Map type O2O: Online Navigation + consumption </p>
						<p> Recent years the rise of mobile map application has gradually become one of the consumer essential app . Based maps of O2O, its mode is the information displayed on the map , but also can access buy, reservations, upload photos, online evaluation and other features directly on the map to achieve from the find orders, reservations, review the whole process . </p>
						<p> Example, RBT , cook impression other catering enterprises , with billions of dollars of high moral map user cooperation, through promotions, online and offline at the same time to promote, so that in a short period a few days hundreds of thousands of coverage levels . In its basic form is : High German map app opened in its preferential activity area , and in the high German marked on the map , at specific locations to achieve the buy page for details and reservations , users can map a web through the high -side and Germany mobile client orders directly on the event page participate in activities , but also to store direct telephone consultation, after participating in the user -to-business meals, checkout POS machine automatically recognizes the complete consumption . Meanwhile, businesses also online through the signboard , poster , two-dimensional code information , etc., to further promote the event. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> All channels O2O: Social Media + electronic business platform </p>
						<p> From the initial public comment to the later microblogging , micro-channel , buy, ordering nets are small catering business effective online tool. </p>
						<p> Example, " vanilla vanilla " original ecology of Yunnan pot through the public comment network , microblogging, buy, network, and other online ordering combination of boxing , grab multiple channels to get a huge amount of new tourists and affect user consumption decisions. Vanilla With its excellent products and excellent service in the public comment online user evaluation carried out a series of incentive activities . The promotion of positive word of mouth reviews online , quickly opened up its market. Meanwhile, the use of herbs also buy bring popularity and crashed through other online daily ordering buy temporary promotion to compensate for an appointment resulting concentrate , package fixation experience inadequate. The vanilla through the microblogging search for relevant content remains interactive evaluation encountered consumer complaints, timely communication and to appease . Microblogging has become a platform for maintaining old customers . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Member type O2O: electronic membership card </p>
						<p> Marketing into transactional marketing and relational marketing , to the highest stage , that is, relational marketing . The emergence of the Internet , no doubt greatly reduces the build CRM database with customer interaction costs, so the micro-channel electronic membership card model, is undoubtedly one of the future direction of O2O . </p>
						<p> For example , fish shop just outside the riverside introduce electronic membership card , through discounts , free gifts and other consumption patterns , in six months, an increase of 90,000 new members. According to statistics , by virtue of electronic membership card stores to shop every day an average of 30 Member (s), the weekend close to 90 tables. Zero-cost electronic membership card not only bring traffic to the river outside the city , but also for its fine marketing foundation. Through the electronic members outside the riverside gender, age and other information analysis found that 70% of members are women, so this data to provide consumers with more targeted products. Such as gift stores are doing activities, will be presented dessert instead of beer , because accounting for 70% of the women members prefer desserts. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> O2O the hotel industry </p>
						<p> Internet brings the hotel industry is a more intelligent digital revolution . Through online mode , the target consumer group hotel to get more valuable data , and use this information to create a more attractive to the user's personalized products. </p>
						<p> Tourism is the earliest Chinese traditional industry areas of integration with the Internet , online this end both famous Ctrip, eLong , there are also a rising star of Mango , the same way network , where to go, cool News , competition is becoming increasingly fierce. IT 's impact on traditional industries , particularly in the tourism complex in this area and in-depth . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Direct style O2O: official website + APP </p>
						<p> Hotel's direct sales model is the line under the hotel company, to establish their own official website as a business platform , put their offline resources through online sales, while taking advantage of their customers detailed consumer information , for accurate analysis, and then cross-marketing . </p>
						<p> Jin Jiang Jin Jiang International Group  electricity supplier formally launched in 2012 , its three products " Jinjiang Travel +", " + JJ enjoy ceremony ", " JJ e cartoon " are responsible for the Jinjiang International Group subsidiary hotels, tours, car rental and other industries exhibition and book sales , membership services, and payment services . Jinjiang electricity supplier members of cross- marketing model , is based on an advanced CRM system and OBIEE ( business intelligence analysis ) techniques . Currently, Jinjiang electricity suppliers in these 20 million customers converted into 8,000,000 members . Each member of the historical consumption data are aggregated to electronic business platform , and the formation of an accurate and detailed analysis reports , and according to the customer before the consumption determine their preferences , and then match the information pushed to customers. </p>
						<p> Jinjiang electricity supplier cross-marketing and achieved good results. Since the launch , JJ electricity supplier 's sales grew more than 100 percent per month , members of the cross- consumption rate reached 30% , which in the industry is a remarkable figure. In addition to building the official website , Jinjiang Group has also developed its own mobile client (APP), in a variety of scenarios provide services to customers . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Distribution formula O2O: B2C + C2C </p>
						<p> Addition to building the official website , the hotel will help B2C platform nature of the OTA ( online travel agency ) to sell their services. Currently B2C nature of the OTA are two major categories : the Ctrip, eLong represented by the traditional OTA; to Taobao travel , where to go, as the representative Inn housekeeper vertical search type applications . Both offer flights, hotels, scenic spots , train -related inquiries and reservation service. </p>
						<p> From high-end five-star Ritz- Carlton , Hyatt , Westin , Hilton , etc., to budget hotels such as the home , the Han court , seven days , oranges , and even roadside Pensions , are somewhat involved in two major categories of OTA , publish Room information , attracting customers from online . In the online and offline integration process, but also creatively developed a very unique variety of online pricing : Hui -election C2B priced hotel the night off , reverse pricing . Rich, flexible, and access to a large customer's online sales, to the traditional hotel industry , bringing a flood of business opportunities. </p>
						<p> And short term rental market rise , put the hotel industry C2C climax . Currently very hot short rental website or APP, such as pig Short Term Rentals, Short Term ants , are very typical C2C mode. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> O2O implementation remains to be industry-wide penetration </p>
						<p> Currently, in addition to the hotel , catering and tourism , other industries are also in trying O2O. Such as housekeeping , wedding photography , but because the industry characteristics , need to be online to complete the transaction , resulting in an online tool more drainage, the role of providing information , which is impeding the rapid spread of these industries O2O reasons . But no doubt that these less mature O2O industry , has not stopped the pace of O2O . </p>
						<p> Therefore, almost all the industries are in route to O2O development . Online and Offline combination , creating a lot of new consumption patterns, the business model for traditional industry to bring a new spring. I believe that with the rapid popularization of mobile terminals , 4G network construction under way in China to achieve rapid urbanization of the environment , O2O for most industries , neither is fantasy, not a dream , but will be more and more common a model. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Industry case studies </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Traditional industries </p>
						<p> Beijing Gallop will Housekeeping Services Limited ( Note : Beijing 's first effort to do network marketing high-end domestic ) </p>
						<p> Relative to restaurants, hotels and other industries, home economics O2O still in its infancy . Although in recent years , many of the Internet industry , service industries have moved into the high-end talent domestic industry inside and brought online advanced mode of operation , but because of the particularity of the domestic industry , the effect is minimal, at its kick the tires , the rapid evacuation . </p>
						<p> The domestic industry , due to the presence of employment contradiction, that no one between the employer and the nanny shared values ​​and judgments , leading to information asymmetry values ​​, while the nanny non -standard products ( services ) , not understanding what you can online , housekeeping service also need to be online to complete the next communication , so many online mode of operation in the domestic industry will not be docked . </p>
						<p> Addition, domestic companies have two brokers : one is a highly educated, able to dock with employers , with the ability to use the Internet ; another is itself a housekeeper origin , specializes in communication with the nanny to forty or fifty years Sister -based, but the ability to lower levels of use of the Internet . At present, the domestic company's management to the second mainly because the housekeeping staff to coordinate the main, which is impeding the domestic O2O an element . </p>
						<p> In this context , the first to do domestic enterprise microblogging Gala will be from the outset and actively explore the development of domestic O2O road , its different brands of Family Services microblogging group , such as aunt came, October fragrant high maternal and child services , Gallop will Yuesao etc., but also opened the Gala will be micro-channel public platform, through microblogging, letter forwarding , interactive to discover customers for sale of synchronization management , sales declared prior to transfer and other activities. In addition , there are business-based "Auntie coming" website to complete the online review , payment and other functions. </p>
						<p> Gallop O2O will practice the concept is to reduce the communication between the employer and the nanny cost . Online nanny and brokers are not only a showcase , a branding , it is a business-based management tool , nannies online with employers , brokers communication between , making thousands of families cumbersome management is simple, becomes efficient and accurate . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Marriott Hotel West Restaurant </p>
						<p> Currently, the Marriott Hotel is mainly through network third-party platform to publish buy, offers, by way of these Online intuitive picture , understand the product more user- related information , to a certain extent, increase the hotel tourists, rich source structure , promoting the richness of the hotel market . </p>
						<p> National rigorously enforce austerity introduced, making high-end restaurants generally affected. Online way through the hotel first formula to ensure the completion of turnover and market share. Because the industry is doing a similar promotion, lagging behind other companies might lose such a network market , at present, Marriott West restaurant guide traffic from online spending accounted for 50% of total revenue . Online hotel brand way , there will be some increase awareness . Superior attitude with different a few years ago , and now five-star hotel hotel lock through online services provided by the style dishes , the hotel's style of the show, to enhance the awareness of consumers and attract them to the hotel spending. In addition, these Online ways to bring some subsequent consumption, wedding , conference room will help, through a platform extension to open a lot of channels . </p>
						<p> O2O in the hotel 's practice, most rely on third-party platform , rather than to maintain the company's own platform, so post-maintenance , website updates, queries and other consumer information there will be some problems. Meanwhile, a number of online promotions, will line a certain impact and influence , the cost is a big challenge. Because online gives consumers a big discount , so how revenues and to find a balance between the cost is critical . Low-end dining may be able to buy through a longer period of time to get new customers , but for the five-star hotel , more through online channels for consumers to rationally accept the five-star price and quality, more obtain customer loyalty . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Internet industry : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> High moral map </p>
						<p> The development of the Internet and mobile Internet has changed many industries upstream source channel. Past consumption may be a ground-based search and word of mouth spread , and now consumers through several channels or internet media portal , more convenient, more efficient, more angles to get comprehensive information on business or merchandise to make consumption decisions and judgments . </p>
						<p>With a priori  map navigation drainage particularly strong , a strong entrance. And web search engines , ground search different map search can collect background data , master consumer behavior , for example, we know Which restaurants, which bank search elements more people , and even to know the daily search on the map how many gas station customers , which in traditional web search engines rarely see , there are some special categories on the map will be particularly evident. For example, we can clearly see on the map , Wanda Plaza, such a landmark building , and its prime TOP10 of the search category, you will understand this position for what kind of crowd to attract a significant role , and understand the propensity to consume . Using this information , we can push for the business quality customers . </p>
						<p> currently has billions of dollars of high moral map users, business cooperation with hotels, restaurants, cinemas, sports shop , nail shop , bank's ATM , etc. , are based on the traditional line of consumer life next business. Every business activity force point is different , depending on the positioning of their own businesses . For example , some need to push the dishes , some want to increase your sales. A large number of user groups and a large store customers, so we can organize a variety of scenes activities to meet the needs of enterprise customers . Meanwhile, the high moral and DT ( content providers ) , for example, and handle, the U.S. group, Group 800 , were also co- produced a large number of orders every day . </p>
						<p> O2O future development depends on the entire Internet, information technology and the penetration of each industry and influence . We can now see that even a roadside store also has its own micro-blog, micro-channel, then the future is the Internet everyone can , everyone can be from the media . Currently, all of the map search elements are carrying O2O various attempts , now is not to give it a complete concept and positioning. But with the outbreak of smart phones , the map search elements in the practice of O2O greater development . </p>

						<p> What is the real O2O? <span class="secondStep"> qualities reconstructed traditional use of the Internet industry supply chain </span>, considered a real O2O. And to do this ( reconstruction ) of the enterprise, has truly O2O business. </p>
						<p> what refactoring ? <span class="secondStep"> is the traditional industries in the supply chain nodes had a point to be cut down, or reverse the order after a two point , it is called refactoring. </span> Before the Internet , most of the traditional industries have evolved over thousands of years , to reconstruct any points that are almost impossible task , they have been optimized despicably optimization , we simply Competition is the head of the manpower resources available , and then see who is at every point to achieve maximum efficiency . </p>
						<p> But the Internet has led to a reconstruction of traditional industries as possible. </p>
						<p> The first wave of the Internet to do the most basic surface tide Reconstruction : <span class="secondStep"> of information aggregation and distribution methods of reconstruction </span>. The most obvious example is the portal Baidu and microblogging micro-channel are at the information level on the reconstruction of the traditional media industry . <span class="secondStep"> people find that they get information ( information aggregation ) has changed the way the past, be sure to subscribe to buy the newspaper reported , including various journals , etc., now all need a , PC or mobile phone you can get </span>; people find their dissemination of information ( information distribution ) has changed the way , <span class="secondStep"> personal blog microblogging through faith in their own voice , no longer contribute to newspapers and magazines post </span>; portals and Baidu who stole a lot of paper media originally belonged to traditional media such as television media content resources and advertising resources, while both the speed of information dissemination is also quite different. The current wave of reconstruction has been basically nearing completion , adding a lot of new media, traditional media practitioners from the media , a lot of street retail newsstand shut down closure , as well as Amazon acquired Washington Post and so on are all proof. </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/6.png"/>
						<p> While the second wave of reconstruction, which is taking place , <span class="secondStep"> for all walks of procurement , manufacturing and delivery and other aspects of the supply chain reconstruction </span>. We can look at a traditional enterprise all business activities , and then put it all eleven order listed here. Such as a restaurant , it's all business activities include: store location, store decoration , menu design, food innovation , food purchasing, receiving and processing orders, cooking and processing, and the chef attendant recruitment, service process standardization , central kitchens , stores and join, advertising and marketing and so on. These activities in which parts can be placed online ? What part can only stay on the line next ? Use of the Internet , to be able to step into the line as far as possible into line, to be able to save the save procedure , before and after the exchange of the order of a few steps ( chronological or logical order ) , so that you can begin to use the Internet on the traditional qualities industry supply chain reconstructed . </p>
						<p> Cite three specific examples below : </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/7.png"/>
						<p class="step"> 1. Dangdang : Dangdang reconstruction Xinhua Bookstore is the traditional mode of supply chain. </p>
						<p> For example, a new book , first printed 5000 , from the Indian plant out later, it points towards the development around the Xinhua Bookstore , in some cities, there are several Xinhua Bookstore , some only one . Which specific Xinhua Bookstore decide how to get a few new books too ? Based on past sales forecast. Past business was good shop take a few more of the poor business to take a few of the little shop . But even so, there are still two situations may then occur: a . Xinhua bookstores selling a home is very good, it quickly sold out , transfer cargo from other stores , if the city has a number of Xinhua Bookstore also easy to handle , if only this one , you have to transfer over from another city . Anyway , time consuming and increase costs. </p>
						<p> Another case , this new book in a store a large number of slow-moving , had transferred back to the warehouse or redeployed to other Xinhua Bookstore . Similarly, time-consuming and increase costs. This one cost the average consumer is difficult to realize . If the book sold only one , it 's a home lying quietly Ningbo Xinhua Bookstore , the most likely to happen is : no one wants to buy it in Ningbo , Ningbo outside nobody can buy it . In short , the traditional mode of supply chain Xinhua Bookstore can not solve the inefficient allocation of the cost increase problem . But the key is that in the past , no Internet ago, no one would think that a cost can be saved . </p>
						<p> Conversely , if it is Dangdang, a no physical store and bookstore managers , there is no branch in batches sent to the country store and transfer cargo between branches of links, which saves a chunk of costs. At this time, if the same book Dangdang also sold only one , it does not matter, as long as there is a country people still want to buy , we will be able to buy this book. Dangdang is nothing more than the increase in distribution costs, but the total cost has also been much lower than the total cost of the Xinhua Bookstore . That is why it is cheaper than the Xinhua Bookstore, the key to so much cheaper . </p>
						<p> So we can see that in the past to dominate the whole of China Xinhua Bookstore books book market , the expansion is very arrogant , rude salesperson general attitude , anyway, you can only come to my new book books bookstore , but you have to press the back cover price to buy books . Now I can not , a variety of promotional discount membership card activity , the salesperson amiable attitude up , but still can not stop the decline, reducing the floor and began a variety of stores, so try to diversify , relying on government subsidies, subsistence . </p>
						<p> Dangdang is actually an Internet bookstore . </p>
						<p class="step"> 2. Taobao : Taobao reconstructed traditional retailing . </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/8.png"/>
						<p> Taobao cut the traditional retail wants to sell something to someone else must have a physical store this link, save a corresponding rise in recent years, the store rent and labor costs . You can even have sold on Taobao fame , and then come back to open a physical store . This is the reverse of speaking in front of the supply chain node order, which is difficult to achieve in the past . </p>
						<p> Taobao expanded the scope of traditional retail sales . Of a traditional retail store sellers only limited to a few kilometers around the customer, its business comes from the natural flow of people through the door and some of the old customers. If you want more people to sell more goods , it is necessary to open more physical store , consider the chain's problems, such as self-employed or join. This is on the increase in the supply chain nodes, but also is not reconstructed . And on Taobao natural there would be no need for the presence of these nodes , these nodes are cut off . Your goods can be sold nationwide logistics reach of any local, national, people can always patronize your shop . </p>
						<p> Taobao to expand the traditional retail sales category . Physical store in the past era, some of the popular commodity, is not someone special shop to sell ; or sold poorly style, there is no opportunity shelves. If you sell these things because it will definitely make ends meet. However, Taobao is the natural range of sales nationwide , the number of potential customers exponentially increasing and reached sales still enough to make an even survived several shop , but are alive and well. For example , after the resignation before a NetEase edited specifically to sell on Taobao mud horse LOGO printed on a T-shirt . This product is a very small minority, but the extent of his business has been far more popular in some busy commercial street clothing store . </p>
						<p> Taobao is actually an Internet shopping mall . </p>
						<p class="step"> 3. Millet: Millet reconstruct the traditional mobile phone manufacturing supply chain , and it is by far my observations on the reconstruction of traditional industries deepest level of the enterprise . </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/9.png"/>
						<p> In the channel link, millet just take electricity supplier channels , that is, can only be purchased online , and completely abandon the traditional mobile phone sales channels hypermarkets , put these in the middle of agent link layers are cut down, save a chunk of channel distribution and marketing costs . At the same time , sales did not reduce the scope of the product can reach three hundred forty-five tier cities. </p>
						<p> In the marketing aspect , millet discard any traditional display advertising expensive , only from the media and other new media, social marketing , and focus on cultivating their own forums. Extensive traditional advertising model , and millet but they can interact directly with their fans , marketing is much more accurate up on . Millet marketing budget this one , according to Lei Jun said to myself, is 0 . The Huawei 2012 smartphone global marketing budget is 200 million dollars. </p>
						<p> In stock links, millet is similar to the early years of Dell's "zero inventory" concept . First there are orders , began production . In fact, this is essentially the reverse of the supply chain nodes around the order, but in the outside world is always out of millet , was accused of excessive " hunger marketing ." Of course , there are some reasons millet orders than expected , due to insufficient productivity of the plant . But one thing must be noted , <span class="secondStep"> hunger marketing ( "first order of reproduction " or " zero inventory" ) is actually the perfect age of the Internet in order to manage a marketing method . Because only in direct contact with the manufacturer to the end user can (end user) of the system, the two sides would be enough information symmetry , manufacturers can quickly know the demand for an item in the end is how much . </span> </p>
						<p> If traditional retail era , playing hunger marketing, intentional ( unintentional ) out of stock , terminals ( kiosks convenience stores , etc. ) and then the layers ( a supplier two suppliers and channels providers , etc. ) fed back to the manufacturer in the end how many consumers have come to over the goods , then the chain is too long , there is a node problems can be easily crumble , the users have adverse effects , leaving the attack to competitors space . The so-called liberalization of millet sales ( every Friday you can grab an invitation code orders next Tuesday , but Tuesday also need to grab ) , in fact, is to make millet plants can have on the demand for an accurate estimate , next Tuesday in the end will how many orders , and thus make adjustments. So basically every mobile phone being produced , they all have the Lord. This also avoids the traditional mobile phone supermarkets distribution after the stock or slow moving ( remember the previously mentioned Xinhua Bookstore 's supply chain model? ) Risks and costs . </p>
						<p> Iteration of the product links, millet also do a completely Internet-based . Millet iterations of hardware and software updates , no longer just rely on traditional internal racking our brains and our own people to do surveys to external customers visit approach. Through forums and various social media , millet can directly and it's users, including users and between users , expand on millet shortcomings and possible improvements of the discussion . While the most senior of the " rice " , millet set up for them "honorary engineer group ," new products DEMO, let these users to experience and give feedback , and these users may be distributed throughout the country does not matter . Lei Jun millet phone to sell so-called sense of participation is , in fact, a way to mobilize the masses via the Internet to do with mobile phones , allowing users to try to participate in the supply chain ( especially product design ) of every link. It should be put in the past is impossible to achieve . </p>
						<p> Millet phone is an Internet phone . </p>
						<p> The above three examples, we will find that whenever you successfully reconstructed the original industry , then you are bound to subvert the previous industry leader, it replaced , which is officially Harvard tenured professor at the University of Christensen (Clayton Christensen) of subversive innovation (Disruptive Innovation). Each wave of reconstruction, are being reconstructed to the original industry subversion . </p>
						<p> However, the degree of remodeling remodeling itself is split depth, deeper shallow layer before reconstruction would subvert the reconstruction . </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/10.png"/>
						<p> Example, began selling books Jingdong , Dangdang is to somehow subversive . Books Jingdong Dangdang supply chain system in general and the same , the only difference is that in the last part , which is the book eventually handed the hands of consumers this process , Jingdong using their own logistics . At this time, the Xinhua bookstore Dangdang original face of those advantages are not. Instead, the quality of service delivery weaker than Jingdong . Jingdong started by the 3C products , such products generally thousand or even million yuan price , it is worth Jingdong self logistics to ensure the safe transit of goods . With this set of high-quality distribution system is simply a piece of cake to send a few books . In contrast Dangdang , because the basic price of the book is not high , they have been taken for distribution and third party logistics cooperation , leading to the delivery experience is very unstable . Jingdong reconstruct the final book of the supply chain ring again subvert Dangdang . Dangdang price shown is continuing to fall , actually to go shop on the Lynx . </p>
						<p> Similarly, Taobao and millet are also not "complete " reconstruction of the traditional retail supply chain and the mobile phone industry , the future should also have to do a deeper remodeling company to subvert them, although we are now difficult to imagine such a company would look like in the end . </p>
						<p class="step"> No reconstruction, no O2O </p>
						<p> Said before , the real use of the Internet O2O enterprise characteristics must be reconstructed traditional industry supply chain . According to this definition , many so-called ground gas O2O cases , including Huang Taiji pancakes and carved sirloin like God , it is not O2O , because they are just across the supply chain in marketing this point, leveraging the Internet, and no "reconstruction" pancakes and sirloin basic manufacturing and other processes. </p>
						<p> Reviews , coupons and buy other is the same, their essence is paid advertising . They are compared to the previous portals and search engines display ads alone goes a step further , which is to help companies across all industries , especially services companies , combined with the characteristics of their products on the Internet to do better marketing . None other businesses can be regarded as a Pay-for advertising , and the effect is to record , track and predict. But their essence is leveraging the Internet to do marketing , and not to any extent reconstruct these industries essential business activities . </p>
						<p> This is why , catering O2O class companies, such as online reservations, ordering , billing , membership management, marketing, etc., in fact, has been spinning in the periphery , never never really in-depth over the catering industry . Because they do, just routine business activities catering enterprises on the one part out, trying to use Internet-based means to improve the operational efficiency of this point only. But as I said before , such as the development of food and beverage for thousands of years in the industry, in fact, all aspects have been developed enough in itself perfect, if there is no reconstruction of the supply chain , and now the food and beverage industry bosses are not the Internet will really seriously . Because in the absence of the Internet in the past , they can survive well enough . If you can icing on the cake , it is naturally good, but without you it does not matter . This is now faced with the dilemma of catering O2O : No one can hit really timely pain points . Several traditional Internet giants are eyeing gearing up, but it is not out of a can and catering market size of the one trillion match was on the giant . </p>
						<p> Perhaps many people think that online and offline can be combined with a variety of O2O, not necessarily so " deep " to reconstruct considered . Here we give a judgment criteria: whether a business operator O2O business , to see if the two O isolation, whether it can maintain its original business model to stay in business . Such as the U.S. group, if there is no internet how would you do it ? It may as well put a home cinema deals through telemarketing and mail order manual way to inform all the city . This is not a comprehensive year Dell popular on the Internet prior to marketing tactics . This way, then compared to the use of the Internet to promote this information, of course, seem inefficient , the cost will increase significantly. </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/11.png"/>
						<p> But the U.S. group 's main business model : to provide to the user a lot of businesses large discount information, and allow users to be able to hold these deals go to the store spending will not change . This is similar to KFC many years ago had themselves through the streets with leaflets and newspapers mail, etc. , sent to the store to use the kind of small to be torn coupons to consumers , and its marketing principle behind much alike . But Dangdang Taobao millet , without the Internet, the end , they would not be able reconstructed according to the original way of traditional industries, supply chain , and they will be forced to return to the original Xinhua bookstore selling books , traditional retailers and traditional phone sellers approach to business selling mobile phones go up . </p>
						<p> Some people would think , O2O should at least be related to a line down to enjoy the service consumption process a reality is that online sales standardized physical commodities relatively easy to play the scale . After reconstruction in your supply chain , but also the scope of sales quickly spread to the whole country , because these goods can be delivery to the country. And if it is necessary orders online , and then go on -line access to services in the industry , the basic limitations in the local domain, a city one case up to now did not appear more compelling reconstruction services supply chain success stories , so I Taobao, Dangdang only cites examples of millet . But standardized category electricity supplier ( including Taobao Jingdong One shop , etc. ) , have reached their most vertices. </p>
						<p> Many people to realize what will happen the next wave of great opportunity for the local services. Line service experience nature of the industry , if there is a successful supply chain is reconstructed , the same applies to this concept , as is the case O2O . For example catering, previously mentioned , we are looking at this one , but no one can be made , because they are doing nothing but using the Internet to " improve " the existing food supply chain node , rather than " reconstruction . " If you are the first truly reconstruct a service industry company, then you basically have a very bright future. </p>
						<p> In addition, there must be a lot of people have mentioned O2O loop , with the loop can how how. Only for the closed-loop and closed-loop , does not make sense . If the closed-loop supply chain to help reconstruction , we must loop , if not to help reconstruct , you lose the concept of it . After all , the traditional industry has been in the absence of the so-called "closed loop" thousands of years , has been going, live good. </p>
						<p> Finally , in addition to the previously mentioned two -wave reconstruction : the reconstruction level of information and supply chain aspects of reconstruction, there will be a third wave of the future should be reconstructed , which is the personality recommendation reached a perfect match . </p>

						<p> As of today , the first in the UK P2P net loan into China has been more than six years , with the rise of the Internet and the domestic private financial prosperity , P2P net loan industry has been explosive development in the mode of alienation and a huge catch up with the pace of development has been Europe . </p>
						<p> 2007 , the first domestic P2P lending institutions pat was born in Shanghai , so far the country has hundreds of P2P organizations , the scale has reached nearly a thousand billion . So many P2P agencies contribute to the development of China's Internet banking giant , also make China 's P2P derived from a variety of modes . P2P is not just the scale of the coming battle , profits of the dispute, the dispute is the mode . Better, welcome Paizhuan ! </p>
						<p class="step"> 1.0 Era : pure online unsecured mode </p>
						<p> 2005,Zopa has been generated in the United Kingdom to the United States as the representative of European countries quickly set off with the wave , Lending Club, Prosper is to get the rounds of venture capital , turnover , number of users very impressive. June 2007 , Shanghai pat loans formally launched, becoming the first P2P net loan company , in September 2012 , Sequoia Capital of millions of dollars to get the first round of venture capital stage . </p>
						<p> Pat completely copy Zopa lending model , operators still insist on doing pure Internet lending credit intermediary platform . In this platform, users publish their own information on borrowers , lending funds to choose projects , websites are only responsible for developing trading rules and offer a trading platform , is not responsible for the trading and post-loan trading money management , nor bear the losses caused by the borrower defaults . </p>
						<p> Pure credit unsecured mode , the platform itself is very small risk , the Internet features make it almost without geographical restrictions, so it is easy to grow and develop. However, based on current domestic personal credit information system does not sound live , borrower credit rating unscientific , difficult to make accurate risk pricing , so the ability to control the risk of such platforms seem weak, purely a large data information control risks , the future is bright but long way to go . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Advantages : </span> platform operation , low cost, low risk itself ; borrowing more efficient and convenient ; small subject to geographical limitations . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Disadvantages : </span> borrowers due to the lack of sound credit system is difficult to make accurate risk pricing ; overdue / bad debt recovery mechanisms and disciplinary mechanisms incomplete, difficult to protect lenders safety of funds. </p>
						<p class="step"> 2.0 Era : pure line mode </p>
						<p> Pat loans online, one year prior to the establishment of appropriate credit pat letter also began to test the water P2P net loan , opened P2P2.0 era curtain. </p>
						<p> 2006 , the Downing founded Yixin wealth. It should be said , should believe business is still essentially a traditional private lending for Yixin , the network is just a publicity channels to attract lenders and borrowers to negotiate business , but also help to broaden the financing source. </p>
						<p> In Yixin , borrowing needs and investment portfolios are broken up by the ratio of capital and staggered terms , while loans for debt , while constantly amount and duration mismatching debt split transfers , the equivalent of a small bank . </p>
						<p> Compared to pure credit loans online mode pat , Yixin risk pricing is easier to control, platform gains and the lender to protect the financial security of slightly stronger , however , is also its duration and the amount of funds for capital mismatch split , assignment of claims , should suffer illegal fund-raising letter criticized . </p>
						<p>Large financial group launched Internet services platform Shichuyouming and seem more logical , in September 2011 , Ping An Group under Lu Jin Suoping station in Shanghai on the line , the traditional large group financial Internet agency layout great prospects . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Advantages : </span> line assessment, risk pricing and more easily controllable . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Disadvantages : </span> illegal deposits from the public , the legal risk of illegal fund-raising bad aversion ; development push personnel , high costs, is not conducive platform expansion. </p>
						<p class="step"> 3.0 Era : Online secured mode </p>
						<p> Proved pat unsecured loans pure online mode is difficult to be successful in China , many domestic P2P companies began to actively seek transformation. 2009 Shenzhen Hongling venture first mention of the " principal protection " system, the borrower overdue / bad debts to provide advanced , industry into P2P3.0 era. </p>
						<p> Such companies is no longer simply an intermediary for third parties to become involved in the transaction , while funds for lenders to provide security , it also attach importance to the management of post-loan funds , while played a guarantor , the United chase people composite intermediary role models . Borrowers website projects developed mostly by the platform itself , so the platform and business risk control and put forward higher requirements . Principal protection requirements of platform commitments assume security responsibilities virtually increase the company's risk control pressure , in fact, rely on intermediary fees charged by the borrower 's profitability is difficult to cover bad debts . </p>
						<p> Development up to now , Hongling venture capital has become increasingly deviated from the traditional mode of P2P platforms turn front of SMEs VC equity investment , venture capital and innovative Hongling Road can go much much remains to be seen . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Advantages : </span> principal security system conducive to attracting lend end users to develop their own project to facilitate risk-based pricing . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Disadvantages : </span> Project production team on risk control and business requirements are particularly high , the platform fallback risk. </p>
						<p class="step"> 4.0 Era : phasor combination of online and offline mode </p>
						<p> O2O is P2P4.0 era synonymous , is currently the most platforms the mainstream model . This model is divided into two cases : one in Beijing peer lending companies, for example , capital development portal online and offline looking for borrowers butt weld line to complete the online matchmaking process ; Second, as the representative of small loans to Ali , Jingdong , Suning closely followed by electricity supplier finance, these companies have a great deal of small micro-enterprise transactions , credit data and can be so reasonably priced , big data under P2P. </p>
						<p> 6 years in China practice has shown that pure Internet model does not meet the current situation , while line business is relatively more straightforward, flexible, fast , field surveys trust more conducive platform to control risk , and more overdue after dunning convenient, fast and effective. </p>
						<p> 2010 In May, all loans in Beijing on the line, it basically followed the inception pat credit model, developed to its O2O business model is basically stable. Everyone 's talking about credit O2O mode have to mention it's important partner " Friends of Beijing UTS Industry Business Consultants Ltd. ," as China 's first batch of Internet-based service platform for P2P credit loans , loans to finance all users group lending its line provides sufficient sources of funding , and the Friends of the letter is responsible for most of the borrowings under the line item docking. </p>
						<p> Addition to the same face as risk control Hongling venture capital and business pressures , peer lending O2O mode there is an important problem to be solved: Currently, the network has covered all loans provinces and cities, a standardized universal control system is difficult to accurately assess the wind around the actual risk. </p>
						<p> Similar to this , Ali , Jingdong , Suning and other large data purely Internet-based electronic business small loans although the processing efficiency greatly improved, but it will also face the problem of the actual line and, in the domestic social information is not perfect backdrop, "Ali who " seems to have entered riding a tiger embarrassment ...... </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Advantages : </span> projects, funding by the platform itself mining, risk more controllable . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Disadvantages : </span> on risk control and business staff quality requirements are particularly high ; risk accumulation , easily lead platform risk. </p>
						<p class="step"> 5.0 Era : guarantee institutions trading patterns </p>
						<p> P2P net loan model from the U.S. and Europe to China, because the personal credit information system is imperfect , and many other reasons, obviously agitated . Domestic P2P companies are constantly trying Chinese patterns , either pure online and offline , or combination of online and offline , has a greater drawbacks, especially the rapid development of the industry , the risk of accumulation is very scary. How to shift the risk ? Shenzhen everyone enrichment in this regard a useful exploration , which pioneered "security agencies transaction mode " P2P is leading the industry into the 5.0 era. </p>
						<p> Everyone enrichment by carrying out with small loans companies, security agencies , who will provide project and guarantees, to give a certain percentage of all enrichment channel fees and guarantee fees , the platform gradually peel assessment project to explore their own work, which saves both risk control and operational costs, reduce the risk of the platform , and built up a borrower , risk control mechanism , all enrichment, financial , etc. win-win platform. </p>
						<p> Current domestic private financial market was mixed, the vast amount of high interest rates , small loan companies and guarantee institutions to survive pressure surge , everyone enrichment pioneered this model integrates the private financial capital , interest rate market , private finance small and micro sunshine and lower borrowing costs has a great role in promoting. </p>
						<p> Appropriate , everyone enrichment platform facing the partner selection problem, and third-party agencies to some extent weakened the platform profitability. P2P5.0 whether as " inclusive finance " to contribute , remains to be seen . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Advantages : </span> to pass a platform for cooperation with foreign risk capital investors ensures more safety ; model simple , clear accountability both partners , more expansion. </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Disadvantages : </span> for the selection of partner institutions have higher capacity requirements ; platform refers to the fees charged by channels and fund management fees, the end of the era of huge profits . </p>
						<p> Overall, domestic P2P essentially out of private lending has not yet essence , given the personal credit information system and domestic borrowing overdue punishment mechanism is not perfect, the degree of social information is not higher reality bound, completely copying foreign P2P mode is not feasible , the domestic industry, contending P2P status will not change yet . </p>

						<p> When traditional financial services and emerging Internet technology, will produce what kind of chemical reaction ? </p>
						<p> Answer to this question is best to use the data to speak : in 2011 , China's online banking market annual turnover reached 780.94 trillion yuan ; the end of 2011 , the number of registered users online banking is to reach 434 million . </p>
						<p> 4.34 million registered users is equivalent to 3.4 times the total population in Japan is 1.4 times the total population of the United States ; 780.94 trillion yuan of the scale is equivalent to 47 trillion yuan China 2011 GDP of 16.5 times . There is no doubt that this is a huge market. </p>
						<p> Online banking a good explanation of the financial power of the Internet combined - state accusing electronic bank counter alternative rate of over 50% , which greatly eased the bank counter service pressure. However, online banking is just the beginning of a financial Internet technology , finance both the depth of integration with the Internet , it is far from full stop . </p>
						<p> " Represented by the Internet and modern information technology, especially mobile payments, cloud computing , social networking and search engines , it will fundamentally affect humans produce financial models ." CIC Vice Xie Ping , general manager , has written pre-sentence, 20 years later, may form an indirect financing is different from the commercial banks , but also from direct financing of the third capital market financial operation mechanism , to be called "The Internet direct financing market," or "the Internet financial model . " </p>
						<p> The current situation is that Internet companies , financial institutions from their respective areas of strength , and from the two cut : third party payment companies , P2P loan companies involved in financial services using the Internet platform ; Bank representatives of the financial sector , the use of Internet technology , the introduction of online banking , e-banking and even e-commerce platform , off -channel electronic revolution . </p>
						<p class="step"> Payment shock </p>
						<p> 6 On 28 May, the central bank announced the 95 new third-party payment license . In just 13 months, the central bank has to pay a license issued four consecutive , currently a total of 196 enterprises of different types of payment license. </p>
						<p> Specifically, the central bank issued the license covers currency exchange , Internet payment , mobile payment , payment of fixed telephone , digital TV payment , prepaid card issuance and acceptance and bank card acceptance , etc. seven types of services. </p>
						<p> Seven businesses , the Internet is undoubtedly a legitimate third party to pay a fortune to pay the land . According to Analysys think tank survey , 2011 Chinese third-party Internet payment market turnover reached 2.16 trillion yuan , compared with 2010 growth of 99%. </p>
						<p> " Expansion is paying big cake together with the bank 's results , both sides are the beneficiaries ." one person said to pay the company to pay the company originated in the Internet, despite its innovative ability, but in the payment chain, the bank is still in a strong position to pay the company in business can not do without banks . </p>
						<p> From reality, to pay the company for the bank's dependence is reduced, the most obvious manifestation in quick payments. </p>
						<p> 2010 Since the end , the majority of companies have launched their own pay quick payment products . Through quick payments, users do not open online banking , you can directly enter the card face information quickly complete the payment , in other words , the entire payment chain bypassing commercial banks online banking . </p>
						<p class="step"> Commercial Banks have described as mixed . </p>
						<p> Called hi , quick payment increases the success rate of pay . This is for banks to make payments by credit card users , but also correspondingly increases the amount of credit card consumer credit card business to expand . </p>
						<p> Called worry , mainly for e-banking department , the quick payment bypassing the electronic banking channels , in this payment chain, electronic banking has been marginalized . In other words, the emergence of fast payment , the impact of the commercial bank e-banking clients. </p>
						<p> " Overall, the bank does not really suffer ." company sources said the payment , electronic banking is just an interface , the bank is to sell their products . As long as the product sold, profits earned , is to take the third-party payment channels , or take our own port and there is no difference . </p>
						<p class="step"> P2P threats </p>
						<p> If we say , similar to Internet payment , mobile payment and other services, but also between banks and payment companies to achieve win-win situation to some extent , then, in the acquiring business , the two sides are yes go fight head-on . </p>
						<p> Under existing industry practices , bank card acquiring business major source of revenue for the fee income . According to different industries , rates were 0.5% to 4% . Fee divided generally follow the ratio of 7:2:1 : 7 return all card issuers , two of the acquirer of all , one was UnionPay all . </p>
						<p> Enterprises to enter the payment before acquiring business market, the main business and commercial banks CUP occupy . Acquiring business income is the bank one important intermediate business income , and even many central banks have set up a card acquiring business unit room. </p>
						<p> But third party payment companies to enter this market, many companies will receive a single payment as a strategic focus of the business , thereby catfish effect has become increasingly apparent. </p>
						<p> " The rise of third-party payment companies , is one of the best Internet-based financial footnote ." a banking source said , the Internet has profoundly changed the society, with ten years ago ratio, screen name and the number of Internet users spend time on the internet has turned upside down . </p>
						<p> Internet companies will be paid into the financial sector , and in the more central areas of finance , but also Internet companies have emerged on the scene. </p>
						<p> Xieping Zhuan Wen said , the Internet banking mode is characterized by the allocation of resources : money supply and demand information directly available online and matches , direct contact and match supply and demand sides , without by banks, brokers or exchanges and other intermediaries . A typical example is the peer lending (peer-to-peerlender). </p>
						<p> According to Xie Ping cited cases , the United States established in 2006 Prosper company has 1.25 million members , contributed $ 307 million of loans between members . Established in 2007, the United States "LendingClub" firms to Facebook as a platform for members to make loans , loans to 2011 was $ 590 million , interest income of 51 million yuan . </p>
						<p class="step"> Business computerization ? </p>
						<p> Xie Ping believes that the supply and demand information is almost perfectly symmetrical , under conditions of extremely low transaction costs , the Internet financial model to form a " full set of trading possibilities ," such as SME financing , private lending personal investment channels such problems become easier to solve . </p>
						<p> This angle to observe, as the financial deepening of the Internet , can be described as commercial banks are facing increasing challenges . </p>
						<p> " Third party payment companies in the Internet payment has indeed lead banks, but that does not mean banks are passive in response to the Internet era ." one source said state-owned big firms , banks with its huge resources, but also has the technology to financial services to see the enormous changes brought about . Although the ship does not turn around , but it's really trying . </p>
						<p> If considered from the product level , the Internet bank to catch a ride , mainly in the field of online banking and mobile banking . </p>
						<p> " Almost bigger banks would set up headquarters organizational structure of electronic banking department ." a joint-stock bank electronic banking sources said the head office has also set up four lines Science and Technology, Software development center a department. Hundreds of thousands of employees in these sectors , almost equal to the sum of the number of other sectors of the head office . " As for money , that is tens of billions of dollars to invest . Banks importance of science and technology is evident ." </p>
						<p> This massive investment, but also made ​​some returns. This regard, the input and output of electronic banking effect is most obvious. </p>
						<p> Conduct case , the bank 's individual customers in nearly 50% of the use of personal e-banking , corporate clients nearly 70% of companies use online banking , the bank also has more than 90,000 Taiwan ATM and other self-service equipment , 600,000 POS machines and 14,000 self-service banking , through these electronic channels conduct annual business volume of more than 300 million transactions , trading volume more than 250 trillion yuan , equivalent to nearly 20,000 physical outlets services volume . </p>
						<p> " But for the understanding of the Internet , the bank can not just stay in the alternative outlets on ." Insiders said that in the current banking sector , a considerable part of the people just as the Internet technology, tools , the bank's core competitiveness remains from the banking business itself . This understanding of the Internet , easy to fall only on technology, do not re- transformation of the cycle. </p>
						<p> " Banks do ostentatious, but the understanding of the Internet is far from us deeply ." one person said to pay the company , in vivo gene internet , it is to pay the company 's competitiveness , which determines its philosophy and technically leading banks . </p>
						<p> Alipay example, the company in its organizational structure, specially set up the user experience department. In personnel, complex banking institutions within the system , to set up a similar division is simply unimaginable . </p>
						<p> Internet-based business will affect banks directly to end customers extends to the front of customers , it is now actively looking for their own end customers era , but also on the banking sector presents greater challenges . </p>
						<p class="step"> Double drive fusion </p>
						<p> From a macro perspective, the financial integration with the Internet is showing Internet companies, commercial banks, two gradually move closer to the situation. </p>
						<p> In the commercial banking side , the total assets of the banking sector has more than 120 trillion yuan , which can mobilize the resources of the large, can be imagined. Relying on a strong financial advantage , in addition to the previous online banking , mobile banking , the commercial banks involved in the Internet day deep . </p>
						<p> 6 months late, while CCB two major on-line e-commerce platform . The " good business personal finance Mall" is positioned as B2B2C platform for individual consumers ; "good financial business enterprises Mall" is positioned as an independent B2B platform for business users . </p>
						<p> " Prior to this, e-commerce has been the Internet company 's sphere of influence ." an Internet source said , although not quite sure CCB 's strategic intent to establish e-commerce platform , but it is at least Bank is actively involved in an attempt to Internet . </p>
						<p> At the same time , the Internet company client, similar to the Internet payment , P2P loans more endless innovation . </p>
						<p> April this year , third-party payment companies - fast money declared B2B field , will provide companies with professional and efficient liquidity management solutions as the future strategic focus. </p>
						<p> " Popular speaking, we want to do is to help companies do more with less money ." quick money CEO Kwan explained that the capital flows that accelerate business efficiency , can really spend a dollar when two dollars . </p>
						<p> Rely on cooperation with banks , fast money not only to solve the company's payment needs , but also the use of bank funds to address the funding needs of the enterprise . </p>
						<p> Addition, paying the money fast and P2P loan companies - net lending Chang signed a cooperation agreement. All users in the smooth online recharge credit funds , which I will enter in the " fast money " and other third-party payment platform web applications exclusively Chang loans personal account real-name system , in which the utilization of funds in the account , you must go through the I on the site the confirmation and the user himself bound with the site name system SMS return confirmation. </p>
						<p> In other words, in the areas of bilateral cooperation , quick money in a way played a role in financial supervision . </p>
						<p> " Theoretically , third-party payment companies combined with the P2P loan companies , you can also further ." Analysts said the company to solve the payment settlement services , loan companies solve their financing services , cooperation in the whole chain , and even commercial banks are excluded. </p>
						<p> If payment companies and P2P large enough and deep enough , then bilateral cooperation , which commercial banks would be fatal . It should be pointed out that, from the current point of view , this trend has not yet appeared . </p>
						<p> As for the future trend of how the future who can do that to understand customer needs, improve security , who is the winner , and the winner is not necessarily the banks, may be third-party payment , it may be other organizations . </p>

						<p> Once the matter to the Chinese , there is something there . </p>
						<p> Twitter in the United States to help Obama win the presidential election , microblogging in China seems to have become the ancient Greek rhetoric Square , despite being castrated too have changed . Amazon's Bezos minded to do the logistics , China 's electricity providers already can not wait to enter the financial profession. Internet banking in China is absolutely shocking fiery , model is endless, the party does not Changba , one has been released . Alipay balance treasure , p2p, Ali and Suning small loans , third-party payment ( EPRO pay , quick money , etc. ) supply chain financing , conveniently carry a model can give to the outside world, " irresistibly " business prospects . </p>
						<p> Although China's commercial business about " Chinese characteristics" , the Chinese Internet business model, but has not been able to break the pattern of overseas Chinese version of the practice. So, now these popular Internet financial model , they Overseas Who ? How about the situation now ? </p>
						<p class="step"> 1, Balance treasure finished version : Balance treasure </p>
						<p> Overseas : Paypal money market fund , now closed </p>
						<p> Paypal company was founded in 1998 , and the following year on the establishment of the account balance of money market funds, fund investors online through the PayPal website to open , provided that investors should become PayPal users . The initial and most small additional investment of U.S. $ 0.01 , the highest account balance of $ 100,000 .

						<p> From Paypal Monetary Fund growth process, the money is not the main purpose of Paypal , the IMF was originally a relatively conservative investment products , Paypal page once to give up management fees and subsidies to maintain the monetary Fund , Paypal move is to enhance user stickiness on the use of Paypal account . paypal money market fund 10 years of experience in risk management is also worth domestic " balance treasure" to learn , mainly investment -quality securities , restrictions are too invested in the fund certain securities of issuers and maturity requirements maturity requirements invested in dollar-weighted maturity of the portfolio does not exceed 90 days, a single securities investment time is not more than 397 days maturity . </p>
						<p> Market has been speculation that , with the interest rate market environment changed for the better , PayPal may re-open money market fund services . </p>
						<p class="step"> 2, P2p finished version : Everyone loans , Yixin , Lu Jin are </p>
						<p> Overseas : Lending Club, American p2p leader </p>

						<p> In recent days, the media of the "balance of treasure" and Ali maintained a sustained financial concerns heat. Cause people are so concerned about the cause, not just because of these financial services or products in the innovation leader in on how similar financial products are already mature traditional banking business, causing hot no fundamental reason is mainly a financial enterprise license , was able to launch some frequent combination of financial instruments, financial products. So, in addition to Paypal, other Internet companies are doing similar behavior can also be extended? Internet companies to expand in the financial business where the boundaries?</p>
						<p> Broadly speaking, the traditional financial services with two boundaries, namely customer needs boundaries and regulatory boundaries. Current economic and financial environment is in the Internet economy and the traditional financial sector interpenetration at the intersection, which bring some financial behavior attribute fuzzy judgment, the corresponding regulatory rules are more ambiguous. Objectively speaking, this is not blurred deliberately by people, but not regulatory or regulatory agencies do not deregulation, but at this stage that the Internet acts intertwined itself with the financial behavior is difficult to simply determine its properties, and this is is currently one of the unique attributes of the Internet banking.</p>
						<p> To understand and accept this ambiguity , we need to temporarily put aside the hot topic of internet banking , go to think about a new technological developments on the proposition : Who is the trunk , who is the foliage ? </p>
						<p class="step"> From branches to the trunk </p>
						<p> Since the first industrial revolution, some of the major techniques from emergence to maturity, are structurally altered human life , such as electricity, steam , trains , cars, airplanes. They appear at the beginning but the whole social life of the small branches and leaves , combined with the established human life change and development. But when it matures to a certain extent , but it will evolve into the trunk by the foliage from the transition to a dominant position with the position , and gradually lead the various market behavior changed , adjustment, evolution . </p>
						<p> From a recognized first electronic digital computer - 1946 launch of the "ENIAC" the emergence of the Internet to the earliest recognized prototype - in 1969 , the United States , " ARPANET " in appear until today , computers and the Internet has profoundly changed our lives, but many people still be regarded as foliage . In the traditional sense of the financial practitioners , the " computer, the Internet is just a tool, they serve in the financial industry ," this understanding is widespread. But the new technology will be gradually developed into an in-depth critical point . Break through this critical point , it is no longer a dispensable auxiliary tool, but the behavior of human production and life support , a " state of life itself ." Undoubtedly, the current Internet has become the carrier of the information age , the information age, the main vein , people's daily life , production behavior , access to information of all kinds , all kinds of information exchange, and even the spread of a variety of social media , are around the Internet expanded. Internet itself is a state of life . The main substantive evolution , making other social actors need to make changes around it . </p>
						<p> From the situation in China's financial industry , the Internet as a foliage aids engage in a financial Internet has almost 15,16 years. From 1997-1998 onwards , the banking industry began in the financial plan and the progressive realization of the Internet , such as online banking services launched a series of related new business. But today, the financial backbone of the Internet as a foliage "financial Internet " continue to perform the marginal benefit has decreased significantly , must gradually to the "Internet banking " to the transformation of the nature of this transformation is the backbone of the Internet , and to Finance for the foliage . </p>
						<p> History constantly prove , if not adapt to this transformation will be eliminated by the society . Before the advent of technologies such as telegraph , " Shanxi Draft " is the Qing Dynasty financial industry representatives , which was then taken Cenway system is very advanced - handwritten secret pressure , a tear in half, when checked against , correct payment . From the internal risk control , incentive system , the degree of modernization of Shanxi Draft is now far more than even some banks . However, due to its modern technology is not sensitive enough , and even rejection , resulting not grasp the progress of the wave wire transfer , still cling Cenway , Escort this set of traditional financial processes, both can not adapt to the social reality of early Republican unrest , nor with the use of new technologies, new financial institutions to compete. Therefore, from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic 's three decades , on the one hand the rapid demise of Shanxi Draft , the other is the use of new technologies such as the telegraph and other old Bank of China , the old Bank of Communications, Beijing and Shanghai three stock exchanges and other new financial institutions flourished. Transition from the old , cause for regret . Development and application of new technologies on the format of the enormous influence is evident . </p>
						<p class="step"> Format spiraling development </p>
						<p> Of course , in any case interpretation of basic human financial behavior , financial needs will not disappear, someone is willing to pay, people are willing to borrow money, this basic form of financial transactions will continue to exist . Also need to see , the Internet banking will inevitably bring about various kinds of " self- finance" the rise , it will also face huge social transaction costs, Internet-based economy, financial intermediaries and financial intermediaries behavior will continue to exist . </p>
						<p> This premise , can be more objectively grasp the current changes in the forms of Internet banking . Fight for example , the earliest financial format is direct financing , barter transactions directly between supply and demand . This behavior is due to higher transaction costs , gradually produced financial institutions , banks, namely indirect finance . With the development of indirect finance are also beginning to not fully meet the needs of the community , has generated in the financial markets as the core of direct finance , VC, PE , etc. are direct financial frontier , its exit is around to expand the exchange . Further down is the Internet banking . </p>
						<p> Internet banking has played the role of two alternatives , one can replace Exchange , "People raise Mode" is the most typical alternative exchange behavior , it changes the entire financing rules , behavior , the impact on the capital market will be very obvious ; another alternative is the indirect financing institutions, the most typical is the P2P lending , is an alternative to traditional commercial banks . In the Internet world, through more rapid and effective access to information, the Internet banking format from the direct financing of the development of indirect financing , and now has returned to the Internet as the carrier of the direct financing of track , showing a spiraling development. </p>
						<p> Therefore, from this perspective, the financial behavior has not disappeared , but the state has undergone great changes , meaning that the entire financial format will produce structural changes . The objective of this change is driven by the Internet economy and the gradual maturation status living in the trunk , the outside of the " spoiler " is only the outward manifestation of this objective impetus . </p>
						<p> However, the Internet and then how financial development , the information still needs identification, risk identification , credit rating , etc. to be assisted , relying solely on the Internet between individuals spontaneously overcome information asymmetry is still very difficult, even chaotic . Even the " self- finance" is also true . Therefore, the information carried by financial intermediation process , risk processing and credit rating functions will not disappear, but their presence under the new environment and a significant change . Most of the past such acts done internally in the bank for internal customers to exercise their intermediary behavior . But in the era of Internet banking , service scope and boundaries are changed, an intermediary between the customer and may not know each other , the information may be accidental , sudden and so on. Meanwhile , if the traditional financial sector is more emphasis on financial information, then the behavior of financial intermediation in the future , it may be more extensive integration of non-financial information , social information , information, time and space will greatly extend the span , ie the so-called big data . When the behavior of various types of exercise financial intermediary institutions are out of their inherent structure, through information sharing large data to respond to all kinds of new and ever- changing needs , in exchange for the survival and development of space, scope and financial intermediation services boundaries will also be expanded exponentially . </p>
						<p class="step"> Rational treatment "supervision premium " </p>
						<p> Now for the whole society , the biggest challenge is how to understand the "supervision fair " or " regulatory premium " issue. Current Internet there have been many properties with financial institutions , their behavior beyond the existing financial institutions for regulatory rules and scope , access to the "supervision premium ." As financial institutions, banks , securities companies, insurance company's operations must be linked with the capital , all businesses are required to be converted into risk assets , risks associated with the assets and capital , regulators through the capital controls to constrain the behavior of the structure of financial institutions and scale to achieve regulatory purposes . In this set of rules , the financial institution to pay a high cost of capital . If this rule-bound and is not binding on the internet bank financial institutions , which means the Internet without paying exorbitant financial institutions, capital costs , they get a large part of the profits belong to the " regulatory premium ." </p>
						<p> Cause the root cause of this situation is still explained above point: the Internet exceeded a critical point , from the leaves grew into the trunk , breaking the critical point of Internet banking , it is beyond the moment for traditional financial institutions regulatory rules and scope . While the existing capital as the core of the regulatory rules , is the result of 20 years of development formed ( with the implementation of Basel Ⅰ counting ) , on the one hand it can be applied to Internet banking ? The other hand, it will take much time for rebuilding ? Also present are the subject can not be answered immediately . Therefore, the " regulatory premium " appearance has become a necessity. </p>
						<p> Of course , there is a point of view is: in the rule is not clear , you should limit the development of Internet-based financial services. This view on the Internet or foliage or when the status of established ( in fact we are so over ) , but in the Internet has become the backbone later , this view is no longer have practical significance. </p>
						<p> Analogy . In the 1990s some banks try to launch pre- paid cards, stored value cards , and later because of some external reasons have been stopped , until today the banking sector has also been banned issue , but that did not stop the development of stored value cards . It is outside the banking system by a third party to promote the vigorous development, and even later also acquired a legitimate third-party payment license . Financial business development is the fundamental driving force or social needs, social needs of the product produced living space , if the traditional banking sector does not provide this service, it will naturally grow out brutal outside the banking system . When most of the daily work life shopping , access to information , communication and other social relations increasingly dependent network , it will be Internet-based financial services has become a necessity of economic development , this time, the presence or absence of regulatory rules have been difficult to blocked. </p>
						<p> You can see, this is still the "Who is the trunk , who is the foliage " problem. When the critical point of a breakthrough after financial behavior is actually transferred to the Internet is a necessity , can only play a regulatory role to ease rather than hinder . In the regulatory rules in place before the internet financial institutions "supervision premium " has become " inevitable necessity under ." </p>
						<p class="step"> Find a balance regulation and innovation </p>
						<p> But the financial behavior of high-risk behavior , after all , the same is true internet banking , financial products in the convenience and ability to find a balance between risk points, depends entirely on the customer risk tolerance awareness. In recent years , the traditional banking business in wealth management has slowly found the balance point , and in 2006 when compared to the combination of financial products , the product and the degree of risk on interactive customer service , great changes have taken place . Internet banking will inevitably go through this process , how to grasp the customer network for different types of financial products risk appetite and tolerance , the only constant practice will tell us the answer . </p>
						<p> As the 1980s , 1990s, the growth of urban credit cooperatives as barbaric , Internet financial firms will certainly experience a variety of challenges and setbacks risks . At that time , the reform and opening up economic activities have become increasingly active, only a few banks are unable to meet the financial needs of the prevailing social , urban credit cooperatives came into being. However, in the era of financial services to meet the demand, it also brings a high-risk, regardless of the purpose of their own business , or the supervision of the relevant state departments have raised new challenges. </p>
						<p> Internet awareness and prevention of financial risks , we also need a similar baptism gradually clarified. Internet company 's internal constraints , regulatory bodies external constraints , both sides have gradually put in place a process . The past six months, gradually some P2P sites exposed some problems financing , this is normal . Especially in high-risk behavior by a number of financial credit profound lack of experience of staff to carry out financial operations will inevitably arise various problems. From this point on that , and very much like the original urban credit cooperatives . But from the historical trend, big twists and turns, big baptism did not block the development of urban credit cooperatives , has evolved into quite a lot of city commercial banks in our financial life plays an important financial service functions. </p>
						<p> Needless to say, China's financial supervision capacity is very strong. But not requiring immediate supervision , management and to what extent , is a question worth exploring . From the big trend, China is in a gradual relaxation of financial regulation on the historical process of economic demand for financial services , the objective requirements of regulation and to find a balance between innovation . Especially in the financial sector has increasingly become the core of social economy , boosters and even when the accelerator , to grasp the art of balance is very important . Blocked risk , risk can only be alienated and ' horizon ' gestation ; ease risk to be directed to the controllable risk track, manage and resolve. </p>
						<p class="step"> Financial reform is to promote the development of direct financing </p>
						<p> Addition, for Internet banking, should also be placed on the economic and financial viewed against the background of large . People's Bank of China recently disclosed to the end of March this year , Chinese yuan broad money (M2) balance has reached 103.61 trillion yuan , the first time exceeded one hundred trillion yuan mark. This again increased the amount of money society widely questioned whether the super-fat and controversy . How to solve the problem of monetary aggregates , in which a major policy direction is committed to making a real alternative to indirect financing direct financing . Only do this , add the amount of money it will not continue to increase ; and with the gradual return of the old loans , monetary aggregates will steadily return. </p>
						<p> From this perspective , all can contribute to the development of direct financing means and methods should be used as the development direction of financial reform , including capital markets , wealth management business , of course, including Internet banking . Internet banking is a very typical direct financing business, especially for SMEs . In this context we may be more confident that Internet banking line with national conditions and needs of the times . ( End ) </p>

						<p class="step"> Current development of village banks </p>

Its largest shareholder or sole shareholder must be banking financial institutions , the largest banking and financial institutions shareholders shall not be lower than the rural banks 15% of the total share capital , other corporate ( including non- bank financial institutions ) , a natural person and its affiliates held rural Bank shall not exceed the proportion of shares 10% of total share capital . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1. Geographical distribution </p>
						<p> The end of 2011 , the national total of 242 banking institutions initiated the establishment of 786 new rural financial institutions , including rural banks 726 ( already opened 635 ) . CBRC data contains both towns Bank institutions , but also contains the village bank opened branches, so the number is too large . If you only consider the Bank towns and villages , as of the end of 2011 , a total of 624 approved the establishment of village banks . The eastern region 261 , the central region 190 , the western region 183 . </p>

						<p class="secondStep"> 2. Organization Type </p>
						<p> Companies in the form of division of village banks , stock limited companies and limited liability companies were two forms , mostly in Co. ; to institutional forms of village banks , rural banks have headquarters and village bank opened its branch in two forms. As of the end of August 2012 , China Banking Regulatory Commission approved the establishment of village banks institutions 1176 , in which the head office 756 , 420 branches , sub- branches of the total number of 36%. </p>

						<p> Figure 4 : Different types of the originating bank initiated ratio of the number of rural banks (2012.07.31) </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3. Initiating row type </p>
						<p> As of July 31, 2012 , a total including policy banks and the State Development Bank / large commercial banks / joint-stock commercial banks / city commercial banks / credit cooperatives and foreign banks and other six systems class banking system institutions 254 Bank initiated the establishment of village banks . Among them, the state policy banks and the State Development Bank 1 , five large commercial banks , joint-stock commercial banks, 7 , 110 city commercial banks , rural credit cooperatives system ( including RCC Associated Press / rural cooperative banks and rural commercial banks ) 120 and foreign banks 5 . As of July 31, 2012 , initiated by different types of lines and the number of rural banks initiated constituted as shown. Among them, the city commercial bank -sponsored rural banks accounted for half . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 4. Rural bank 's business scope and profit model </p>
						<p> Rural banks may operate public deposits , short-term, medium-term and long-term loans for domestic settlement , bills discounting , engaged in lending , bank card business , issuance, redemption , underwriting government bonds , agency payments, and insurance agency business and other businesses approved by the CBRC operations . </p>
						<p> As an integral part of the financial intermediaries , mainly from rural bank deposit interest earnings . The successful operation of rural banks depends on three things: the availability of funds , the use of funds and financial security . Adequate funding is to ensure the normal operation of village banks based on the effective use of funds and security can not only improve the minds of the people in the local village bank 's credibility , but also can improve their profitability and achieve financial access to and use of a virtuous circle. </p>
						<p class="step"> Two , rural banks for SME financing support </p>
						<p> Village banks in rural areas is based on small and medium sized joint-stock banks , flexible operation mechanism , SME financing in alleviating the plight of the effect. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1. Organizational model innovation </p>
						<p> In terms of scale , China's rural banks is the real meaning of the " small banks ." Village banks is small, but it is an independent legal entity , is a legal entity , distinct from commercial banks branches. Single bank village banking model system , relative to the total branch-based banking branch offices, banking management concept can reduce the tendency of large urban centers , the formation of free competition environment ; improve rural financial services and SME financing QOS , facilitate the coordination of the relationship between banks and local governments to better serve the local economy ; fewer layers of management , financial regulatory authorities in favor of management and control. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2. Competition model innovation </p>
						<p> Village bank 's competitive advantage prominently reflected in its ability to engage in relationship lending , while the relationship lending information for solving the problem of financing SMEs opaque significance . Relationship loan with a lender rely on exchanges between potential borrowers to obtain information and make loan approach. The relationship between lenders and borrowers generally formed from the two sides in the course of long-term exposure of financial services , such long-term exposure to help gather information on the lender and the borrower loan repayment probability prospects and other information . A considerable part of this information are " soft information " is difficult to quantify, the verification and delivery , such as on the business owner 's character and trustworthiness and other information. In the soft information collection, transmission and use , rural banks such institutions has its own unique advantages, which is engaged in relationship lending their time showing comparative advantage. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3. Soft information advantage </p>
						<p> In the credit markets , small businesses, farmers, self-employed and other small borrowers often lack can share directly outside the public information , it is difficult clearly reveal their credit standards. As a result, these borrowers need to produce soft information based on relationship lending methods . In rural banks on relationship lending comparative advantage exists in our country , the problem of financing small enterprises are still more prominent , and thus , promote financial organizational innovation , nurture and develop a number of village banks, indeed a practical significance of selection. </p>
						<p> Soft information gathered on the edge. Village banks with regional characteristics , which can help with small businesses and other potential borrowers to maintain close and effective close contact to obtain / accumulation of a variety of soft information . On the other hand , based on local rural banks with strong geopolitical , its employees and credit managers , mostly from their own communities, and local businesses / individuals are inextricably linked , allowing no-cost or low-cost way to fully grasp the local information on the stock . </p>
						<p> Soft information passed on the edge. Soft information with non-standardized , subjective color density , fuzziness and personification and other characteristics, which are mostly proprietary information about a specific object , it is difficult to summarize the form of a written report statistics . Soft information transfer on the difficulty of large complex in the organizational structure within the bank is reflected more clearly . Many large banking organization intermediate level , transmission chain length, soft information in its internal multi-level pass , the more prone to distortion. In addition, with respect to the complex structure of large financial institutions , with a simple structure , flexible operation mechanism , independent and strong characteristics of rural banks to avoid the occurrence of the above problems also has inherent advantages . </p>
						<p> Advantage of the use of soft information . Village bank institutions generally have concentrated ownership structure characteristics , which were mainly from the local community and rural institutional investors and managers of local business owners. In contrast, large banks generally publicly listed company with its bank branch managers often do not have substantial ownership relationships , while rural bank branch managers have a strong sense of ownership , will motivate them to pay more efforts to collect soft information , trust of its shareholders and will be consistent with the objectives and ways to use the information. </p>
						<p class="step"> Third, the prospects for the development of village banks </p>
						<p> Can already be seen from the data in the past few years, rapid growth in the number of rural banks . With the country's future financing for SMEs and small financial institutions , " agriculture " support of financial institutions , is expected in the coming years , rural development banks have mushroomed up in the rural financial system in place. The main reason is the basis of which there are four . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1. Capital supply and demand relationship </p>
						<p> A long time in China 's rural areas, a large area , a huge number of farmers is difficult to obtain the necessary financial services to their financing needs and other financial service needs are often not met. Financial vacuum in rural regions , the rural economy and farmers' income has been greatly restricted . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2. Economic base </p>
						<p> In rural areas, private capital is extremely lucrative , in many areas , huge private capital formation and private lending private financial network . Moreover , in this period of rapid economic development , China's agriculture is facing a historic opportunity for development, is also facing the industry restructuring, rural financial needs are immense . In the context of this trend and the rural financial system reform and development becomes extremely necessary . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3. Policy foundation </p>
						<p> Introduction of a new country every policy will inevitably fad 'policy Typhoon " , paving the way for the implementation of the New Deal . While supporting the implementation of the New Deal , the state often in the industry and commerce, taxation, finance, technology , land , energy, transportation , etc. to provide all the convenience . Practice has proved that those who closely follow the policies and good policy making full use of living of people , most from the New Deal to get maximum benefit ; whatever cautious, hesitates , indecisive, wait and see , often miss the opportunity to make a fortune . Who benefit most from the reform and opening policy in rural rich leaders , will seize this golden opportunity to plan and quickly build rural bank specific matters. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 4. Era of rapid urbanization background </p>
						<p> Advance of urbanization must be accompanied by the development of modern service industry , in the process of urbanization in the development of the financial services industry is the question of meaning . As a native of the local village banks banks in the process of urbanization can play to their geographical advantages , and actively expand the radiation radius , enhance their own strength . </p>

						<p class="secondStep"> Observed by the central bank : This is the Wing Lung Bank Chairman Ma Weihua, September 14 at 2013 Seventh China Bankers Forum on the text of a speech Record . Editor's a small part of the abridged . </p>
						<p> " I think that Internet banking , in a sense , and it is a traditional bank , the whole demand for social services are complementary , the network should be to a certain extent in the real world , I think the network is more developed , especially in the more advanced third-party payment , equivalent to boost bank payment , media functions , extending from the real world into the corners of the online world , which is the last bank can not do . " </p>
						<p> Just said about the definition of Internet banking , I am in favor of our president Ng definition is actually <span class="secondStep"> financial financing , this Internet-based financing </span>. </p>
						<p class="step"> Internet Financial Definitions </p>
						<p> Now more broad concept, one is the traditional commercial banks to our traditional business via the Internet to do, this started early , moved to the traditional use of the Internet to do business , called cement and mouse . </p>
						<p> Second category is the Internet business to do banking, intermediation of funds to do business, including settlement business. </p>
						<p> Third category in the past imagined , is purely internet banking .
						<p> I think now we are more talking about relatively narrow concept of the Internet companies to do financial business , and now as more and more banks are talking about this thing. </p>
						<p class="step"> From cross-industry competition - the weakening of bank intermediation </p>
						<p> But to today , and now the Internet is not a bank's own financial industry competition , that you who use online cement and mouse do well , is derived from cross-industry competition , so Ma often told me , he said Ma brother you can not do this , I can do it. Pony horse challenge . </p>
						<p> Are currently Xiaoling told , <span class="secondStep"> first one is the third-party payment </span>, I just said the bank two functions in the field of payment developing very fast, third-party payment has now approved a 250 almost , that their growth is still more than 200 licenses awarded , they increased almost 100 percent more than a year , now more than 2 trillion , soon 40000 billion in 2016 to more than ten trillion comes , this volume is very large, but these just as Xiaoling said, the inevitability of its existence , it is the frequent occurrence of large number of small , very fast this Taobao occurred, and these banks really do not tell the truth, people easily , <span class="secondStep"> I say it should be, Ma thing you do is right, you do not look the diversion of my business , I say you still for my burden </span>. </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Second is the mobile payment is Internet-based business </span>, mobile payment development is also very fast , because now the mobile payment , and now China 's mobile phones are 450 million payment , the transaction volume last year was 150 billion , probably in 2013 to over 1 trillion , explosive growth . Last year, we engage in a two mobile payment , one is with the cooperation of operators , with the SIM card , the second is cooperation with handset manufacturers , but this only addresses near field payment , <span class="secondStep"> future we the goal is to replace credit cards for remote payments, this is not very far away things </span>. </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> There is a network lending </span>, just Xiaoling also spoke network storm is borrowing from Shanghai landed in 2007 , and now to 2012 our P2P network platform has more than 300 in China , the entire loan amount of about more than 60 billion , the amount is not great now . But it was this child Liaoyuanzhishi developing very fast . I said yesterday in Davos, a French foreigner in China, he also engaged in P2P online payment , he said he was in high spirits , it can make money , that is, this child , the general financial roots can also be done , so to say this is definitely a very big market. However, these banks can also be done , for example, ICBC's net loan . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Fourth is to raise public investment </span>, a credit of everyone , this is a purely internet banking , all the chips off the investment one to operate the public financing of such a revolution, but in China it seems to have been a lot of restrictions , relatively fast development in the United States , especially in the pre- consumption has become a new trend when all the chips consume just come up with an investment projects to attract investment, for music, games, start-ups , applications, fashion design, including your creativity to design a movie , you can finance . Recently, a movie like , two weeks to raise the 1.58 million , so that to find a lot of creative enterprises . But this thing is illegal fund-raising in China there is a boundary , I would figure out how to do this thing in the future , so China still subject to many restrictions . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Then there is a just talked Money </span>, banks are adept in the past , but now the balance of treasure after launch , just mentioned , through Internet sales of fund products , this can put now become a large financial fragmented financial management , minimum 10 dollars, I think this may be the future for the majority of people , there may be some impact , like fragments of finance, because the balance of treasure before a few days to 20 billion , and now there are a lot of treasure in the balance continue to apply such a product , since you let go , it is not one of the . So I want to do now through the network of financial , relatively fast development in these areas . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Then these aspects , it is enough to remind commercial banks should not be underestimated , and a commercial bank is faced with the problem weakening the role of financial intermediaries . Commercial banks because in the past he is also information flow , capital flow concentration . Commercial banks to obtain information, Internet companies are now so far broadly so quickly , and the openness of the Internet enterprise information integration decision he is more sensitive than the commercial banks , which is the advantage of the Internet . </p>
						<p> My day Davos Forum , arranged for me and Facebook female CEO Sandberg , have a conversation with her , and I hope with her a pair of what we now consider the commercial banks the results of this host have to be told we are talking about men and women leadership differences , so I talked to her this has gone, I have always marks do Facebook I still think a lot of you are like Facebook has 1 billion real-name system for customers, which 1 billion there certainly also the supply of funds , there is demand for funds , and now with the first search engine , you can put together an orderly arrangement of supply and demand , then there is cloud computing, there are credit system , then it can be a capital requirement for each person to make a risk-based pricing assessment , each person has a hand plus mobile terminals , this thing is done , if they themselves are free to love , and that banks useless. </p>
						<p> Now is still not up , Xiaoling me about your point of view , it is hard to shake the bank. But now there is a saying that the Internet will become the bank's financial Terminator , this is terrible, I have just one Xiaoling a talk I was a little confidence. Banks still not necessarily immediately end , this is a weakening of the role of intermediary . </p>
						<p class="step"> Banking service mode change </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Second , commercial banks face the traditional service model to reform </span>, we are now all these years , customer-centric , we still accepted this idea, also remember that there is a CMB because of you , creating a Chinese banking product-centric to customer-centric historic change , the evaluation on the CMB is still high . In fact everybody are also doing so. </p>
						<p> Because you do banking services, is you do not understand your customers' needs , they can tell you how to run it ? You open the hotel do not know your customers eat salty , that people can come? So the banks are customer-centric . </p>
						<p> But Internet companies has his own style , he is characterized by respect for the customer experience , and emphasizes interactive marketing, coupled with the open platform , and more emphasis on the mode of operation of the Internet technical and financial core technology combination. I think this is a traditional bank also can not do now , especially large number of these small and micro customers. </p>
						<p> Also banks are now willing to do small and micro enterprises , this I do not mean false, because it is not light response to the call of the thing , because there is a requirement Basel Committee , he put a large business risk all reset to 100%, 75% of SMEs could Assembly children want this thing how can you be so fixed it ? The Basel Committee believes that large corporate default probability is low, but the loss given default rate, which means he is a problem, are connected with the economic cycle . So the loss rate is difficult to avoid , small and micro enterprises , small enterprises is 75% risk weight is to do his business save 25 % of the capital . Why does he think so ? He is also a high probability of default , loss given default rate is low, this is a very simple truth, the principle of large numbers , more good than bad guys . </p>
						<p> Our credit is dried so that you do not see the credit card is not guaranteed mortgage, more good than bad guys . So now the bank then this additional capital more difficult ? So all banks are saving capital , in order to conserve capital , want to get high returns , and that only a small micro-enterprise most accounts, but do not say that small and micro enterprises do it , you should have each enterprise risk get, are clear , due diligence, you do not do on the loss , and this hundred and eighty million , and one day you go to investigate two people that can do it ? Therefore, such an approach must be found , such an approach , in fact, the Internet business is the most advantageous . </p>
						<p> You say Ma to do this , Alipay , Paypal accumulated Taobao customers, a lot of information, which is very precious to him , and then a small credit by virtue of these materials Ali day trial 8000 pen, you think, how many pen an hour , and he alone, the information , so he would be reduced, he was this bad rate is not very high , you do small and micro enterprises , have to bulk , professional , industrial land, and risks identified several indicators , the United States Wells Fargo , the original tenth largest bank , about $ 100,000 to do a loan , so that the largest U.S. banks do today , the original fourth-largest now the first big, profitable. So this is the Internet business is a challenge for traditional banks . </p>
						<p class="step"> Source of income shocks </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Third is the source of income shocks </span>, you think the bank two business , one of the credit interest income, the second is to pay fee , these two have been disintermediation , then you definitely want to reduce banking income , the original bank can sell funds , selling financial products, banks have huge channel edge , and now the Internet can also be sold , and this certainly to divert part to go, so there is no doubt that this income should be subject to bank some of diversion and reduction . So this is the challenge we are seeing banks . The challenge is also often makes us think of the future , the future, if there is money , then this bank certainly will not end. Even money on future do not exist , I do not know how else child banks , and now it is an unknown . </p>
						<p> But I think , the Internet or any of a scientific and technological revolution, the challenge for you to raise demand at the same time , he also made ​​a deal with the challenges will certainly address this demand approach, which I just said that 15 years ago, Bill Gates said the statement, but the bank did not become dinosaurs, banks or in the good to be alive. </p>
						<p class="step"> Banks historic opportunity </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> The development of Internet banking , although commercial banks constitute a serious challenge , but I think there are a lot of historic opportunity. </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> First proposed the Internet to give you one, it can be personalized to customer service , allowing customers to experience better </span>, which can also be completely commercial banks make you as I used to , we can also make use of network transmission , the use of cloud computing , the use of vast amounts of data for analysis , just before I came I went to visit Tian saw cloud computing , big data analysis of customer behavior now or very interesting , you can analyze your customers in this period , the types of products that customers need what kind of need which level of products , so you can complete and accurate precision marketing , can be used in a commercial bank on . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Pricing , especially in risk-based pricing , you can use big data technology </span>, as I said, Ma Alipay him this accumulation data , of course, are a large number of small business data bank for so many years and has accumulated a lot of the medium-sized enterprise data, which is very valuable , is how these data further digging , you can give and medium-sized enterprises, but also can provide customized services. In addition, I think the bank will also help tap new value . </p>
						<p> <span class="secondStep"> Although cyberspace has developed rapidly , the network allows us to draw closer in the virtual space , but you can not shorten the distance between the reality of physical space . Networks can provide vast amounts of data , but not able to solve real trust between people problems . </span> is now in the Internet age , effective information , humane and realistic sources of trust , I think this is a must, and in this regard, the bank due to historical reasons , because of his business characteristics, he still has a very big advantage. I think that by virtue of these advantages , <span class="secondStep"> banks can put their trust in the media , paid media , the role of the media channels for further play . </span> </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> I think that Internet banking , in a sense , and it is a traditional bank , the whole demand for social services are complementary , the network should be to a certain extent in the real world , the more I feel that the network developed, especially in the more advanced third-party payment , equivalent to boost bank payment , media functions , extending from the real world to the online world the corners . Banks can not do in the past . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> From another angle , for the present, the development of these third-party payment companies faster , their money , the more I feel that banks should be more happy, because they ultimately bank's customers , they also put money in the bank , so the current circumstances, our traditional banking and banking network is entirely complementary, do not take it as a confrontation , in fact, the pressure of online banking to the bank , but also the innovative power bank . Xiaoling just talked about the case of the Internet , this is the way banking innovation . </p>
						<p> I think we as a commercial bank , but also to adapt to this era , there is now a fashionable word called wisdom of what has happened, it is IBM invented, I want to build a wisdom bank bank , completely with this point of view to do big data analysis market customers , marketing, doing the bank's capital measurement , price management , which is entirely possible . Banks can further cost savings can be further risk prevention . </p>
						<p> I would also like to further through the bank network, the Internet is now the largest banking network is characterized by interoperability, even the more widely as possible , so that the banks do not put their own systems closed , <span class="secondStep"> if the banks in the case of control risk among banks , banks and different kinds of businesses have more interoperability , then I think we can be a greater advantage to be complementary . </span> </p>
						<p> I want to face competition from the Internet , as a challenge to traditional commercial banks is definitely yes , in the past you eat food alone , but now people of a cup of soup , and it also points to a bowl of rice, also points more things , you have to recognize this reality. <span class="secondStep"> as a commercial bank you want a little more genes internet , so I think we jointly meet this era, commercial banks would not end. </span> </p>

						<p> Used to love carry small cards in English , even if Mr Ma also learning to fly , and now has a new " hobby ." He often handheld iPad, words coming out of "big data ", "P2P", " cloud computing " and other network language, he dug in the global financial top IT experts , and sent special assistant specializing in Silicon Valley and other places to collect the latest IT technologies. </p>
						<p> 58-year- old Mr Ma , mastering the Chinese traditional financial aboard ship in peace , in an integrated financial model maverick , and now he gives peace new target - Accelerated into the interconnected finance. </p>
						<p> Alipay Ma , Ma has TenPay , and now Mr Ma also have a " safe pay " , headquartered in Shanghai, Ping An Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. has been officially payment operations, in addition , Ping spend 1 billion yuan to build the used car business platform Shanghai automotive electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. was safe , in addition, Mr Ma and networking giant Ma, Ma " three horses" co-founder of the insurance company " Zhong An online Insurance" is also operation . </p>
						<p> Peace group seems to rise up against the traditional Internet companies, financial companies , a typical microcosm of many financial companies seem to be the last two years began to plan the internet banking business, and their difference is, Ping An Internet banking has long been hunting war has begun. </p>
						<p class="step"> Without wallet </p>
						<p> Mr Ma to enter the payments industry is not accidental . Not so long ago , Mr Ma led the team and team brainstorming 360 companies , and Zhou chat mobile payment, the payment of all the links from the idea of ​​peace , the idea , to acquisitions, joint management team, set up a new company , to determine the company 's profit model , the whole Mr Ma is the surgeon himself . </p>
						<p> By Ping An Group Chairman Mr Ma 's invitation , the original DBS Bank in Hong Kong and Mainland China retail banking director Wangjie Feng joined Ping An Group , is responsible for paying business. Wangjie Feng also served as vice president of Citibank China and the Netherlands Bank China CEO . In addition Wangjie Feng Ping pay there are still many banks or payment industry background with executives , senior vice president and chief technology officer and vice president Wang Wei Zheng Yide previously were leading online payment company PayPal office. </p>
						<p> Zhengyi De Mr Ma for the first time and the experience of talking to payment impressed , "he even predicted that within the next decade , 80 percent of mainland Chinese use of cash will disappear in the next 20 years , If you do not put the vast majority of small and medium banks foreground outsourcing, will be difficult to survive . " while Mr Ma opinion, is a small electronic banking payment services , especially in the mobile era , payment business prospects unlimited. </p>
						<p> This and the former Merchants Bank president Ma Weihua views coincide. 2011 , Ma Weihua raised within the next few years to "destroy the credit card" , meaning this is not really eliminate credit card payment , but the credit card and cell phone one. Was kind enough credit in other banks when competing with children , Ma Weihua ideas of how to allow customers to be able to take to the streets without a wallet . </p>
						<p> Data show that in 2012 China's mobile payment market transactions amounted to 151.14 billion yuan , while the size of the market segment transactions from the structure, near-field payments accounted for only 2.6%. Ma Weihua himself said , a bank in the financial development of the Internet as , at best, can be a little faster than others , "Customer demand is everything , the Internet is not a bank financial development can handle things , is bound to become parties to cooperate and share tendency to form a good final payment atmosphere , this way, banks, merchants , and customers will benefit . "</p>
						<p> The face of the rapid development of Internet banking , banks and other traditional financial industry is feeling unprecedented pressure and challenges , and past fund trading , financial product sales , bank deposits , especially demand and settlement deposits are an important business banking , banks charge substantial fees for the bank brought huge profits, but the first to appear as Internet banking , this cake will undoubtedly be split , the bank had to add " war " . </p>
						<p> However, the " no permanent enemies , only permanent interests" , traditional financial companies have begun to focus on the Internet information technology used in customer segmentation, products, services, research and development and integration. </p>
						<p> Example, ICBC officially launched the micro-channel banks to provide, including 7 × 24 hours of artificial counseling, self-inquiry and information access services ; Construction Bank were offered good financial business platform , providing customers with wholesale , retail, and financial services such as a comprehensive settlement , hopes to accumulate large amounts of e-commerce platform transaction data, the development of different financial products ; CITIC Bank with money paid through cooperation , hoping the third party payment platform integration products , to carry out a small business network credit , and recently launched mobile near field payment services . </p>
						<p> Compared to the financial sector banks on the Internet multiple attack, quick money CEO Kwan seemed very calm, "I'm doing the same with others to make a standardized product. internet banking in demand more than that, as long as the customer can meet the basic needs is a good product . "</p>
						<p> In Kwan 's eyes, for a successful Internet-based financial company, in the field of innovation will create new demand , generate new business , who can quickly meet these needs, occupies the largest market share , who is the winner , while sticking to the existing business is a dead end , and now , Kwan and that he discovered a new demand into real products . </p>
						<p> " First-class cabin with many empty seats often can not pay the upgrade fee of several hundred dollars , so I sit ; Or first class meals good, I do not want to sit there , but want to try sitting in the first class Economy ' taste ' ? flight attendants say yes , but money can not close this way, the demand for payment had . " Kwan said , upgrades , if able to upgrade information together with the boarding information processing , and so on , third-party payment companies can do so many things , is the core of all applications to provide greater added value to the airline . </p>
						<p> " I explained to the airline boss ideas , which can be used to double the efficiency of the first class , and I only charge 1% , the airline boss is pleased to accept, because they can realize their revenue earned more . " Kwan said , in addition to upgrades , but also includes the high sales on international flight duty free items when the plane of the goods directly to the customer. Believe that this huge demand , the key is nonexistent everyone says bank robbery business, banks are willing to cooperate . "This in an enclosed space where the pay huge market, such as airplanes, trains , buses ." We are talking with several airlines , they are very interested. "</p>
						<p class="step"> Who to borrow money </p>
						<p> Decorating the house, change , open mobile phone shop , investment nursery ...... open peer lending sites, borrowing interface varied. This is usually 35 million borrowers for many people is a very embarrassing financial needs : little money , loans, listed class financial benefits of such companies shall be at rest, they do not feel worthy to catch a favor to an acquaintance Zhang mouth ; but hold down a penny hero Han, loaned would not work . </p>
						<p> In China , the world's 1 /4 of the large population , enough to make this piece of land to become a paradise for microfinance . This is all loans , favorable net lending platform P2P network such business space . </p>
						<p> As of June 30 , 2011 formally began running peer lending has totaled 10 billion yuan in turnover , with a feverish pace continue bolted. "Basically maintained an annual eight times faster ." Li Xin He then calculating the credit will be able to complete the next six months everyone a 10- billion, and will achieve 10 billion yuan in three years, the volume of transactions . </p>
						<p> Graduated from Peking University Department of Financial Mathematics Li Xin He is one of three founders of all loans . He has worked in Deutsche Bank Investment Department , BOCI Direct Investment Department and the Bohai Industrial Investment Fund's work , convinced that the Internet can change the existing financial environment of Li Xin He who after nearly six months of market research in preparation for the increasingly popular abroad . " P2P " model in China . </p>
						<p> "P2P" mode in 2005 by the British Zopa website first , then quickly in the United States , Europe and Japan replication. Their slogan is " abandon the bank , everyone has a better deal ." They provide a network platform for both lenders and borrowers , and lenders to borrow money through the website registration and examination, with borrowing needs of individuals will be posted on the dedicated website information , financial information through the people to choose their own hopes lent objects , all transactions are done online. </p>
						<p> For P2P , the business models and regulatory policy neither stereotypes , and it is these missing, let P2P industry has been developed in confusion and doubt . As with the small loan company's risk control standards are different , P2P companies are particularly conservative , cautious, in Li Xin He seems to establish a comprehensive and effective credit review system that can help companies minimize the risk of the lender overdue . </p>
						<p> Fact this is advantageous network are doing , the company and the Ministry of Public Citizen ID Card Centre in addition to many other third-party organizations , but also on their own separate risk control timely and effective system to distinguish lenders authenticity of the information provided . Screening also do it again . Favorable network 's founder Liu Yannan introduction, enabling network and FICO FICO ( the world's largest credit approval technical service providers ) cooperate with its score card fraud network modeling favorable current credit management system, enabling network Chief Risk Officer the original Standard Chartered Bank's " cash loans faction" , and "small micro- lending business , is responsible for ensuring the quality of the borrower . </p>
						<p> And peer lending pioneer these P2P companies compared to the public to raise financing is undoubtedly a "little brother" , but also in foreign countries just three or four years development . "People raise " mode as the U.S. site Kickstarter 's success and the rise , in this mode , anyone can send their own entrepreneurial ideas site audit released by the website , users willing to give financial support , the return is the corresponding products or services. Raise public site from successful projects to extract a certain percentage of money as a reward. </p>
						<p> " Roll call time " is the founder of the congregation to raise China's first website in May 2011 , founded upon time and formally launched two months later . In addition , focusing on support for music "Le Tong music ", dedicated to financing micro-film , "Amoy Monternet " and the congregation raised platform also attracted entrepreneurs in different sectors , for their dream to build a showcase to attract investment arena. </p>
						<p> Zong Ru is the former project manager of the University of Melbourne 60 GHz , structure and integration of the person in charge . Home business , he tried to "naming Time " was released on Wi-Fi smart sockets project reached its target amount limit . Before the release of the second project , Zong Ru with and "naming time " with a warm-up form , so that consumers participate in product design and positioning .

To date, the platform raised a total of nearly 6.5 million yuan , the amount of a single month exceeded 1.5 million yuan fund-raising , project financing for the 14,000 yuan average . </p>
						<p> Time named CEO Yu-Chen found that the domestic market is the amount of $ 500,000 from the fund-raising projects span to 500 000 to 100 million in projects, including the design and technology class project category phase easier to succeed. These two projects off price higher , especially tech projects , there are some smart devices related to hardware design and production, the industry chain is longer, more funds are needed , but also need more financial support . In the roll call time on the platform , nearly half of the users from the first-tier cities such as Shanghai and Beijing-Guangzhou and more spending ability. So Yu-Chen and his team consciously guiding line the city's scientific and technological projects of entrepreneurs to initiate projects on the platform . </p>
						<p class="step"> Another money </p>
						<p> Financial sector development on the Internet more and more blurred the boundaries when it arrives to knock another new thing , and that is the Internet virtual currency , a typical representative of bitcoins , Q coins , Facebook credits , Amazon and other currencies . </p>
						<p> These virtual currency is best known for bitcoins . Since early 2013 , as a roller coaster price fluctuations so that the " Bitcoin " into the public's perspective , gradually attracted people's attention, " Bitcoin " is a P2P virtual currency , 2009 was born too early and did not cause people 's attention, but popular cryptography discussion groups . </p>
						<p> 2008.11.01, a person claiming to Nakamoto in a secret cryptography comments posted on a discussion group representations , presented his new electronic money imagine - Bitcoin this available. A year later, the first Bitcoin transaction is completed . Data show that in 2010 the initial bitcoin transaction price is only $ 0.03 , while this year, Bitcoin price volatility as a roller coaster , which was as high a peak conversion Bitcoin exchange $ 266 . </p>
						<p> Conceptually speaking, Bitcoin is an open-source P2P software produced by the electronic money , is a network of virtual currency . Bitcoin monetary institutions do not rely on a specific issue , it is through a specific algorithm generates a large number of calculations , Renyiyitai bitcoin can access the Internet on a computer management . Regardless of where anyone can dig , buy, sell or receive bitcoins . </p>
						<p> If the yuan is Carrefour issued prepaid card, you can buy a range of goods ; Bitcoin is a commissary then recharge cards, counters where things are numbered. However, there have been thousands of merchants worldwide to accept bitcoin payments, including the Spanish fashion brand ZARA, trade website season mall, hydroponics equipment suppliers East West Hydro, U.S. merchants Luxury Living Direct bathroom products and so on. Bitcoin transactions are also becoming more popular in China , a number of shops on Taobao platform able to accept bitcoins as a payment method . </p>
						<p> In China , " Bitcoin " because one fund overnight. After the earthquake in Sichuan Lushan , One Foundation announced its acceptance of bitcoin donations , just a few days they received 233 bitcoins , equivalent to 220,000 yuan . This is China's first to accept bitcoin donations NGO , Bitcoin is also the first time in our country has become a donation . Since then, the network of trade in the active individual who - some Taobao shop also began to accept the use of bitcoin . </p>
						<p> Incredible is that this electronic money actually has been in the United States to become legal. Latest reports, Texas A judge on Trenton Xiewo Si (Trendon Shavers) Bitcoin virtual hedge fund (Bitcoin Savings and Trust, BTCST) cases ruled : bitcoin will be considered currency , so all the associated investment funds and transactions are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities Act and subject to the supervision of the federal justice system . For this position, bitcoin players believe that this will not only make bitcoins into real financial supervision , has become bitcoin really into public life to start. </p>
						<p> Xie Ping, deputy general manager of the investment company expressed concern Quedui bitcoin , who has worked for many years in the People's Bank financial experts believe that the Internet and the legal tender currency convertibility , would affect the financial stable , he said , humans long ago to implement a private currency , each with their own credit banks issuing currency , the bank has sufficient reserves or gold preparation. The Internet virtual currency and legal tender velocity is totally different , the central bank is difficult to know the Internet circulation of money and issuance , it may have an impact on financial stability . "The Internet Money birth is inevitable, the impact on the future of human society should be fully prepared ." </p>
						<p> Currently, bitcoin still belongs to new things, the vast majority of ordinary people still retain its wait and see attitude , but in the financial sector , especially securities, currencies and investment , practitioners who did difficult to keep calm . Billionaire Lewis is also optimistic about the development of virtual currency Bitcoin , Bitcoin mining machine wishes to invest $ 200 million company Avalon . Lewis is known for currency traders , he teamed up in 1992 Soros sniper pounds. </p>
						<p> And Bitcoin virtual currency such as the Internet but also to finance this new thing practitioners difficult to keep calm , and now , it seems that it is time to join them up . ( Fengyi Meng Ho Fei / text ) </p>

						<p> Recently, the individual consumer credit (Peer to Peer) credit platform Prosper announced that $ 25 million re- investment . The current round of investment by the company long-term investor lead investor Sequoia Capital , Blackstone investment participation. The timing of this financing seem strange , since January this year, Prosper has just won a $ 20 million investment in the month they restructured the leadership team , and the appointment of a new CEO. </p>
						<p> 2006 formally launched the Prosper in this financing has been obtained before the $ 94.9 million investment , so now they get outside investment totaled 100 million $ 19.9 million . Prosper said that this financing is the beginning of a new year is an integral part of the development direction , not under pressure . Actually, the reason is very simple : This year in January the newly appointed management team and $ 20 million investment in the business model is to explore Prosper bet , if successful it will bring more money . With the subsequent strong growth Prosper , Sequoia Capital will invest more money. </p>
						<p> January of this year , Prosper platform credit totaling $ 9,000,000 , to August this figure soared to a $ 32 million , almost equal in less than a year's time quadrupled . Prosper is expected that the annual turnover on the platform may be more than 360 million U.S. dollars . Prosper said the official website since its inception, the platform reached a $ 630 million borrowing , the amount of this year accounted for more than half of them . Prosper said the $ 25 million of the financing will be used "to accelerate the company's growth ." Surge in the rate on its credit terms , financing seemingly vague grounds may be true . </p>
						<p> Prosper 's competitors include credit clubs (Lending Club), and to some extent also with Kiva competition. In today's financial environment, public Prosper demand for such services is increasing in order to lock the capital gains . The problem is that potential funding for such services is sufficient to support the total size of these companies in the next five years to maintain development . I think , as long as the Fed continues to use leverage to maintain a lower overnight lending rates traditions , Prosper are facing market is extremely broad. </p>

You can say that the world electricity providers within the financial play is the best Japanese Lotte . Lotte preemptive , and vigorously expand the network of financial services , partly because the network of financial and electricity supplier has a natural connection , electronic business platform , and platform on the accumulation of a large number of real transaction data for financial services to build the network provides a unique advantage ; another respects with the Industrial Bank of Japan Lotte founder was born , did Softbank investment and other large financial adviser for investment and financing institutions . </p>
						<p> Japan 2011 Internet penetration has reached 79.1% , the number of Internet users is 9610 million.

For 70% of transactions are paid by credit card " Rakuten Ichiba " is concerned , credit cards are the major source of funds controlled consumption of means of payment, close business relationship with electricity suppliers , like credit card at Lotte concerned Alipay Ali 's position as important and indispensable . Meanwhile, consumers in the " Rakuten Ichiba " consumer records can be issued credit cards credit basis ; Lotte will bring the credit card business and other fee income revenue growth ; addition, consumer credit card can not only online , but also available online under the Consumer online and offline consumer common points can be obtained using a card to get through the online and offline consumer scene , is bound to become Lotte O2O deployment of the weapon .

						<p> Question: Some businesses are now on the table put a micro-channel two-dimensional code , after the first use of sweep can get relevant offers ( such as a T cola and the like ) , but for businesses and words , why did he do that ? </p>
						<p> If I were a customer, I'm going to a restaurant for dinner , that is, to eat, but will not go to sweep away a can of Coke restaurants go , preferential restaurants in itself is exposed , after going to know whether a discount, so the business is concerned there is the possibility of increasing the amount of users is still small , but each comes with a new user account as long as the two-dimensional code scanning , you need to pay the cost of a can of Coke , thought to understand why businesses do that ? </p>
						<p> Trouble please everyone all possibilities under discussion , or they can be discussed under the micro-channel is the method used to convince businesses to do such a preferential activity ? </p>
						<p> Added : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1. These deals are already there , I have not taken into account , but I go to a restaurant that is not true , but others are already there , is worth think about ; </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2. Improve their visibility , which I very much doubt that my problem was mentioned , the exposure is how to improve ? People who do not know the restaurant to see through other channels , then went to a ; know the restaurant is a person back again ; </p>
						<p> Micro- channels at 1.2 on the letter did not comply with all reasonable and that exposure comes from where ? </p>
						<p> And this way it will create a tricky : </p>
						<p> First, we had intended to go to that restaurant for dinner ( note that is good has been determined , which deals with the micro-channel no relation ); </p>
						<p> Secondly, we found that restaurants have micro-channel promotions , so people who have been swept with a vest and then sweep again, lie a Coke , no people swept directly with their own micro- signal sweep ( note , brought here only to registered users of micro-channel ); </p>
						<p> Finally , the restaurant gave each of us a bottle of Coke , which is the sum of the cost of business consumption. </p>
						<p> We go to a restaurant is not for Coke to go, go in advance because the restaurant itself , the micro-channel I decided to go to a restaurant during the did not give me cause to go or not to go influence ; Finally, the client go restaurant to restaurant brings a certain cost consumption ; </p>
						<p> Thus, in this logic of the nominal discount, I had doubts. </p>
						<p> Answer : A while ago Internet Conference, Ma announced O2O micro-channel in the direction of the layout . Then, live electricity provider Tencent Ministry daizhikang also TenPay Communication conference speech , elaborated "two-dimensional code + Account System + LBS + pay + Relationships chain" to line businesses to bring change. Even cutting-edge media Cheng Ling Feng also admitted that " public comment finally have reason to tremble ." A time practitioners in the fields of domestic O2O a jittery . But for me personally, is not optimistic about the micro-channel in the direction of the layout of the O2O . In this regard there are three questions Xu : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1) Ideal full, the reality skinny </p>
						<p> Micro letter to us to portray a beautiful story is the " promotion of businesses to spend money to advertise online coupons, coupon usage conditions is to shop with a micro-channel micro-channel two-dimensional code scanning membership cards Member businesses directly through micro- channel to establish contact with the user , the value of the media agency will shrink . later business ads directly through micro- precise letter issued . " story speaks great, but who is going to pay ? </p>
						<p> Micro-channel membership card only after packaging concept , in essence, a public account. Yes, now I am concerned about the tiger sniffing and other micro-channel public account, but this is due to the push technology media day for me valuable content. But what I have to pay attention to a bunch of people Xu merchant account and endure its push advertising messages ? Is it crowded subway every day waiting for the elevator opened and closed even go to the bathroom before you are crazy enough advertising ? If we say yes to enjoy discounts and membership points and other services, such grounds just buy Fudge former merchant's logic as pale : merchant discount is given , the user to store consumer once, after these people to become your repeat customers . In fact, the user wiped his mouth after dinner went off the next - are losing money anyway, do one , are also considered from the people, giving back to people . Of course, the user may also be more than one mouth Cawan action is to remove the micro-channel account concerns . </p>
						<p> Secondly, the value of the media agency is so easy to replace it? Intermediary class service value lies right information to do aggregation , cleaning , sorting and classification , user information needs in a proactive time to make a choice . We've done user research data show that 85% of people have the habit of local consumer demand directly to the Internet when searching . Try to skip the media intermediary of restaurants and this layer allows users to directly establish contact , eyes have micro gourmet examples: Sina microblogging platform relies on account of the restaurant to host marketing, business conditions how we had an idea . </p>
						<p> Final say micro-channel coupon mode. Of course, with a two-dimensional code to facilitate online statistics settlement settlement , but from the perspective of merchants do ? This will not only want to increase the hardware procurement and personnel training costs , but also increase the difficulty of a single escape ah pro . Give discounts subdivided commission , in addition to Joy This high handsome rich merchants gathered in a show willingness of the lot, who bird you ? In addition to restaurants , for example, the service inventory is limited, the more signs loud restaurants, attendance at meal time more natural full, there is no intention either of these businesses offer coupons , or price discrimination means to limit the use of coupons use of time . Result , conditional businesses not willing and not willing merchant conditions , this is the paradox coupon platform . </p>
						<p> Recent micro-channel is being shoved public platform , from social networking to social media already Mai pace a little faster , then bring TenPay ambitious line into open loop , the idea is good. However, stretched too thin , several Division lead brother but also often in Shenzhen and Beijing to fly back and forth between playing , is unlikely to happen overnight. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2) Line : micro-channel of the long road arena
						<p> Into O2O micro-channel nature of the problem is whether there is leveraging Tencent line merchants genes and form a closed loop to grasp ? </p>
						<p> Tencent's product managers really understand the user and the product , with her golden spoon born micro-channel ideally opportune . But in the face of such strong O2O operational needs, using the current play , micro-channel is a bit overrated line merchant acceptance of information technology ? </p>
						<p> Still catering industry as an example . China 's catering industry is still in a Until Manjuan , Nishajuxia wilderness era, industry leading enterprises and the lack of market merger integration , low levels of information standardization ( see a wide variety of tax control machines , POS machines , a la carte and CRM systems right ) . Placed in front of the most realistic business is not marketing optimization problems, but to solve the problem of how to survive tomorrow . For this reason , business yellow pages information gathering and dissemination become a bitter and tired of the business, every big city in China , with an average close to one tenth of each month restaurant information for a license to be updated as failures . In the proper way Jenna , in order to provide the most accurate and timely information services, we operate every day spend huge human cost in the restaurant data acquisition, validation and updating on . </p>
						<p> From the perspective of BD , scored Joy easy , after all, Shopping Mall Merchants department to give you butt . The remaining millions of merchants how to talk ? If you can imagine the restaurant where the waiters county home sweep can hand code reader , open micro-channel leisurely standing in the doorway to solicit business , you know that micro-channel will be faced with what a long road arena . This turtle speed mode of development is really suitable for micro-channel such Hurricane Mengjin wealthy do ? Frankly speaking, according to the current micro-channel play, the pace towards the line is likely to stop at the first-tier city's top shopping district . To some extent, Xu would think by some large chain businesses do their own branded mobile application , but some of the more tricky . </p>
						<p> Fact, micro-channel business model can copy the QQ, but if so , it is bound and QQ conflict , and ultimately a zero-sum game. The shooting itself in the foot thing Baidu has ah done before , Ma Ying-jeou of course, do not want to repeat it. First with QQ to establish social relationships , and then activate the micro-channel line consumption, which abacus crackling . </p>
						<p> It into line , it implies the need for the merchant - Users - Product tradeoff between the three games . White lounge CEO Sharon Yu said a word in the product family , Xu was impressed : Do not forget the line merchants for passenger traffic , the Internet will never be the role of complement . Outstanding people in the face of China 's Internet business when the original ecosystem , whether there is sufficient awe-inspiring , this road will be a key factor in how far to go . Borrow Liu Cixin in the " three body 2 - Dark Forest " in the sentence to sum up : the weak and ignorant never survive the obstacles , arrogance is. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3) Really open , or false open ? </p>
						<p> Micro-channel product itself can always make people smell the faint hint of contradiction: on the one hand , micro-channel open API available to third-party applications for the post in the session information from third-party applications ; the other hand , micro-channel payment platform used their own TenPay , local business platform uses its own QQ dishes , and even scan code is self-developed software . </p>
						<p> It also appears from a certain extent reflects the current Tencent impression : MingMian said to build eco- offerings , openness and win-win , is still privately must not let outsiders fields , first with the flow to feed their own cards large bit-level products. The skin in the autumn sun to do to send help reminiscent of some years ago , can not wait to fill the Wikipedia search results page , you know , and paste it Baidu - Baidu , but in the end it is still open to Aladdin playing it. </p>
						<p> We all know that native mobile applications, products recognizable concepts are important : the user are fragments of time using mobile applications , the purpose is very clear, if the product positioning is not clear , it is easy to miss user scenarios . Micro-channel core positioning of the product itself , the mobile Internet is still a basis for communication social platform . Perhaps the future will be social media platforms , no doubt . And if shoehorned into a "two-dimensional code + Account System + LBS + pay + chain" Luandun concept , I question micro-channel product managers , you are not really worried about micro-channel users Yun Cai do ? </p>
						<p> Traditional Internet pivotal links pointing to relations in the mobile Internet era , in fact, evolved into an open API calls between applications relationship . From this point of view, open ecosystem , with an excellent third-party applications together to micro-channel core, a platform for online and offline interaction Troops . After all, no one wants to see a mobile Internet traffic black hole - pro , think discarded after being condemned by Google Maps Apple iOS6 it. </p>

						<p> Technological change lives. Starting from the counter , to online banking, telephone banking , mobile banking and then to micro-channel bank , domestic commercial banks IT technology is undergoing a " leap of evolution ." July began , another one with a different characteristic of the " micro-channel banks " have been on-line order " beachhead landing war" broke out . For many bank customers, the more concerned about is the " micro-channel bank " is used , techniques, Beijing Chinese Commercial News reporters Qin Shen and Ti Yanliao 12 opened a micro-channel banking and micro-channel service platform for commercial banks , from the functional richness and the use of convenience we give advice. </p>
						<p class="step"> Feature-rich </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Credit Card </p>
						<p> Micro-channel platform in credit card services , can be divided into two categories, one category is as China Merchants Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank , China Everbright Bank , Guangdong Development Bank , " micro-channel operating room ," the credit card series features ; the other which is part of no real sense of the " micro-channel bank ", but individually set the credit card service centers, such as CITIC Bank, Agricultural Bank, Ping An Bank. </p>
						<p> Merchants Bank , China Everbright , China CITIC Bank not only set up the appropriate credit card balances , bills, credit inquiries and other functions, and also set up a quick repayment channel open . If Everbright Bank can be directly authenticated credit card payments , then jump to the Merchants Bank mobile banking page can be completed quickly repay. Bank of China , Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Ping An Bank, Huaxia Bank set up credit card bills and other major inquiry function , such as the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank only need to enter the last four digits of the credit card you can directly display the current credit card bill arrears. It is worth mentioning that, while China Merchants Bank and Ping An Bank opened a bill installment features , CITIC Bank will set up a "I want to do card " column, can be the main card , additional card and other cards online handle , after perfecting the relevant information , just waiting for audit to the counter to confirm. In addition , the Agricultural Bank of micro-channel services are mainly still in the product information, promotions of other basic functions, and Bank of Communications, China Minsheng Bank 's credit card feature is still in the growth stage . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Financial products </p>
						<p> " Signing micro-channel banking, wealth management buy their favorite products, through micro-channel direct purchase " , some commercial banks of the " micro-channel bank " can already achieve " micro- finance " service. Beijing Daily reporter noted that Shanghai Pudong Development Bank , China Everbright Bank , China Merchants Bank financial products can be purchased, differentiated Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and China Everbright Bank can be achieved through micro-channel direct purchase , you need to jump to the China Merchants Bank mobile banking page. </p>
						<p> Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and China Everbright Bank need to be signed before they can complete the purchase is completed , bank customers can check real-time account balances, transaction details and other information. It is worth mentioning that the above three banks can check details of financial products , in the experience of the process, Beijing Chinese Commercial News reporters Gan Jueguang and Tai Yinxing Products table setting more concise , clear , visual effects more comfortable . </p>
						<p> For security issues, China Merchants Bank , Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and China Everbright Bank will require customers to sign in advance , and then enter the appropriate card numbers, passwords before they can buy . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Special Service </p>
						<p> Merchants Bank set up a money transfer service functions and I have to credit the page , but also need to transfer money transfer services to mobile banking pages , and I want to credit you can directly fill customers' personal information It will have direct contact with the customer demand for loans Commissioner for customers. </p>
						<p> Also many banks pledged to further optimize the micro-channel banking functions , such as the Bank of micro-channel banks will be launched in the near future to further artificial micro-channel bank transfer services, providing remittance , financial management, local life , no card withdrawals, mobile phone recharge , credit card bills and credit check , credit card payments and other services quickly ; SPD Bank will soon launch micro- teller , micro payment , micro remittance , micro- finance and other functions ; Guangdong Development Bank will also continue to cover the account inquiry , repayment , investment , loans, payments and many other businesses . </p>
						<p class="step"> Ease of use </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Query Service </p>
						<p> Month's credit card that also how much money , how many bank card account balance ...... Today, the cardholder through the micro-channel bank will be able to query the above information. Beijing Daily Reporter survey found that China Merchants Bank , Bank of Communications , CITIC Bank Credit Card , China Everbright Bank , Ping An Bank credit cards, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank , Guangdong Development Bank and other micro-channel platform can check information such as billing and balances , customers need to make the first use bank card binding. </p>
						<p> In addition , Bank of China micro- banks , ICBC e- banking micro-channel platform can offer interest rates , exchange rates, gold and silver prices and other financial information ; ABC's " e-banking micro- navigation " also provides micro-channel account the " Find your nearest ten self-service banking ," " self-service equipment Tunka taken from the line card information inquiry points " and other special services. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Outlets search </p>
						<p> Almost all customers have encountered bank outlets queuing thing, bad luck and even customers have to wait half an hour to one hour in the bank micro-channel platform that makes the most intimate . " network Query "column. According to Beijing Daily Reporter experience now the Bank of China , China Merchants Bank , China Everbright Bank , Shanghai Pudong Development Bank have opened this service , not only can check with the banking hall outlets, can clearly see the windows line up all kinds of business information, customer according to their own schedule and make an appointment , avoid queuing . However, in use , the China Merchants Bank customer's own needs in selected cities , enter the position key words, such as " Chaoyang Gate ", the system will give the location of nearby outlets , queuing number of tips, driving and walking routes. The Everbright Bank customers need only point in the input field "+" sign , and then the selected location , the phone will automatically send location information , customers can receive bank branches near the tips . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Customer Service </p>
						<p> Previously encountered business consulting, Tunka , report the loss and other problems, people often used to call the bank customer service hotline for help. The emergence of micro-channel bank customers and banks have another way to communicate . </p>
						<p> Current bank micro-channel platform, intelligent customer service and online customer service modes. Intelligence Service is a more basic, the Agricultural Bank , China Merchants Bank , Ping An Bank , Industrial and Commercial Bank, China Everbright Bank , Bank opened a customer service consulting services to micro-channel platform can provide . </p>
						<p> However, encountered a complex issue , not all banks will be automatically converted into artificial intelligence Customer Service . For example CITIC Bank Credit Card micro-channel platform, " inquirer" will be said: " You ask this question to the inquirer to live, and wait for me to meet again next time again去打听打听tell you ! Or You ask something else ! " Agricultural Bank of China Customer Service center , although it will provide online advice and comments artificial two options , but the service is not 24 hours labor , customers can choose a message or call the customer service hotline of the line . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ● Micro-channel platform experience </p>
						<p> Rapid development of Internet banking in forcing banks continue to reform and innovation , for such a micro-channel bank for customers of the new platform , various commercial banks naturally far behind. The industry had predicted , micro-channel will become banks, the fund industry 's Internet financial experimental fields . But for this new thing , the banks have different reactions , has opened a wide gap. </p>
						<p> China Merchants Bank, China Everbright Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and China CITIC Bank credit card, micro-channel in the same industry -leading platform . The Agricultural Bank, China Minsheng Bank, China Construction Bank, Huaxia Bank and other banks still in testing or integration phase , not yet formed a function of better micro-channel bank . </p>
						<p> Individual banks micro-channel platform management more confusion , for example, in micro-channel number lookup column in the public search for a state-owned big firms will pop dozens of numbers associated with the public , and even some account names exactly the same, attention after the discovery, some branches or business department account, easy to give customers the impression of confusion . </p>

						<p> [ Li Kui Zhang Zhishen : </p>
						<p> Banking business may be so big , so banks allegedly area 70% smaller than traditional , also more than 200 square meters, the number of employees fell 60% ! Cost savings is very obvious, but also improve the user experience. Although this feels so incredible bank can operate , but give an example we may suddenly see the light . </p>
						<p> Is not difficult to imagine the home improvement materials and home improvement services can perform O2O sales ? It sounds difficult, but I've seen a real hit home improvement ( month turnover of hundreds of millions ) and the new nest net on the vast majority of customers are able to achieve from the Internet . They would take the user to the drainage line stores or relatively remote place to trade partners , buying home design packages and home improvement materials , solid hit nearly 80% ( new nest is 100% ) to the first site to complete the transaction , the transaction amount in 20,000 or more. Bank sells virtual product , it can be said in this regard are also more space ] </p>
						<p> 2013-08-31 central observation </p>
						<p> Bank cafe ? Sounds tricky, in reality it happened . </p>
						<p> ING Direct, this by the ING Group in 1997 's first direct bank , is known for its innovative business model for the Internet to subvert people under the bank's financial imagination . </p>
						<p> ING Direct ING through the line of the cafe to support online business . ING Direct in key cities with financial consultant function outlets for the brand to provide a line of real existence , although a small number , but let the consumer banking presence felt everywhere : the user can rest in the physical outlets , and bank customers manager contact, which narrowed the distance between banks and their customers . More importantly , customers can also access online banking , access to a wider range of financial services. </p>
						<p> This is reminiscent of the dazzle O2O word , O2O both are online to offline, can also be made offline to online. </p>
						<p> Jiang Jianqing , chairman of labor words , this Internet banking should be " brick + mouse " is online and offline are integrated. </p>
						<p> Central bank observed that in the context of Internet banking , the bank line after the physical network is a service, sales, display platform , customers can realize the physical outlets within reach banking services , but more importantly , the bank can store the customer interface through the introduction of the cloud , and in the infinite virtual network services to provide a wider range of sales . </p>
						<p> This path , gave us inspiration , like so many outlets four-line banking , Internet banking in this wave of the tide , if you can combine online and offline , there are likely to get opportunities. </p>
						<p> In this regard , ING Direct opened our horizons. </p>
						<p class="step"> Internet-based financial model : ING Direct </p>
						<p> Source: Banker magazine </p>
						<p> Author : Fei Dawn Dou Yuhong </p>
						<p> ING Direct from ING Group (International Netherlands Groups, 2012 Global Asset ranked 20 ) in 1997 in Canada 's first direct bank , with great success , and rapidly to the global countries replication. Experienced in 2008 after the financial crisis , ING Direct and gradually shrink , sold in North America and the UK and so many of the direct banking business , focus on European business development. ING Direct the development process for us to explore the direct banking model provides a more comprehensive and systematic experience. </p>
						<p class="step"> Strategic positioning </p>
						<p> Before the establishment of ING Direct , ING Group 's overseas corporate banking and insurance businesses have occupied a certain market size, but there is no retail business , ING Direct 's aim is to set up expand overseas retail business, becoming the world's largest online banking, business development support for the parent company . Early stage of development in online sales only simple products such as savings accounts , until only recently in some markets to full-function banking transformation . </p>
						<p> ING Direct operations in overseas markets, long-term vision , usually in the target country 's first direct banking market , ie about three years to achieve breakeven . </p>
						<p class="step"> Target customers </p>
						<p> ING Direct will target customers are: 30 to 50 years of well-educated workers , have accepted or via telephone, Internet banking , income levels higher than the market average , willing to self- finance . From the second quarter of 2006, research firm Forrester research results in Europe , ING Direct succeeded in achieving development goals target customers . </p>
						<p class="step"> Business model </p>
						<p> Products . ING Direct sales by simplifying the process of product categories and make financial services easier , while also reducing the customer demand for banking services . As the CEO of ING Direct in the United States Arkady • Kuhlman (Arkadi Kuhlmann) has pointed out : " the complexity of the bank is wrong , we advocate to simplify ."

						<p class="step"> History Summary </p>
						<p> The financial crisis, ING Insurance and banking split into two plates , in which the banking sector in the world , there are three operational modes: in Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg Economic Union mode , mode, and in the large emerging markets, organic growth in mature markets of ING Direct mode. </p>

						<p> And to the Internet in the raging tide beneath , whether Internet companies engaged in financial services , or banking and other financial companies to enter the Internet field, are seeking synergies , rather than a simple multi- technology . In fact, corporate culture and nature of the business a huge difference between the two into each other's areas of strength but there will be absolutely obvious suited. Therefore, banks and Internet companies in two niche areas overlapping portion is in direct conflict both sides of the battlefield . Among them, the bilateral platform competition in the most central position , there is no platform resources companies want to build their own platform, and platform resources owned enterprises are seeking to establish their own payment , loans and other functions. </p>
						<p> Both compete mainly in the overlapping part </p>
						<p> Niche areas of financial institutions </p>
						<p> Deposits, cash business , international settlement , low -risk loans , custody , investment, investment bank , the sale of complex financial products , trust , etc. </p>
						<p> Overlapping sides of the battlefield </p>
						<p> Internet bilateral platform for the construction of small and micro loans and consumer loans, online payment , collection and payment , insurance , guarantee commitments , brokers, simple sale of financial products </p>
						<p> Internet business areas of strength </p>
						<p> Software development and sale of hardware equipment production, in the initial phase of the development of new technologies and new models </p>
						<p> Thus , banks and Internet companies are hoping to get some overlap in the two sides more markets and interests. If, however, their lack of strength in the case , continue to maintain the "winner takes all" rules of the game , both sides the result of competition will become very tragic. So for non- heavyweight financial and Internet companies , it faces is not the optimal game strategy is to develop and operate their own independent of the other advantages of the project , but the cooperation and outsourcing . Thus, for some small banks, throw away the burden , to seize the opportunity, in a timely manner and firmly grasp the lifeline network entry and flow "BAT" class Internet companies to establish cooperation platform for customers to use their capabilities , coupled with its own good financial services business , complementarity , cooperation and win-win , but the ideal would be a realistic option . </p>
						<p> Of course , in addition to other than small banks , the majority of medium-sized banks will still continue to create their own electronic business platform . From " Currently 16 of the 14 listed banks already have their own bilateral platform," illustrates the trend of Internet competition is evident. But how to sort out and exploit the existing data , to create their own unique financial Internet model , establish their own network core competitiveness and achieve differentiation advantages still need ruthless much thought . </p>
						<p> Although the bank passively stationed Internet industry to build their own platform the ability to obtain customer acceptance is not known, but based on the bank as long as a large customer base , to provide customers with better service perspective especially great banking customer base , within the system in the formation of the bank's customers to fully tap the resources and use , it may not feasible road , perhaps the scale do not necessarily great, but after a fine production will benefit very obvious , the ultimate goal of positioning in the banking ecosystem optimized to provide customers with better differentiated services , increase customer stickiness , without the necessary electricity supplier profitability so that customers prefer to stay in the banking system , if you really can the goal intensive, perhaps the road is also not a bad idea . </p>
						<p> In addition, large-scale development in the era of Internet technology , the bank not only to keep Internet companies compete for customers and the market, should continue to have the network with the strength of the banks compete , in this process, the more good application of Internet technology , the integration of the Internet thinking financial institutions , there may be a competitive advantage, so how to achieve this change , may be the next to go carefully consider the core banking point . The above, the current battle zone financial intermediaries on the Internet at a distinct race passive defense state banks, to create and develop their own Internet-based financial model , hoping to reach a certain advantage , from the following aspects: </p>
						<p class="step"> One to enhance the strategic position of Internet financial development </p>
						<p> Corporate financial channels on the Internet under the impact of major commercial banks greatest extent possible, the Internet banking rose to the level of the Bank's development strategy , rather than just the annual report on the work of a small projects. Bank management needs to recognize that the Chinese economy in an increasingly Internet-based , only the current situation , the bank 's competitive position in the Internet economy has been significantly worse than the line economy, but big Internet companies are constantly pulling on the banks of the competition advantage. Internet business platform in the fast bigger, relative to the bank's first-mover advantage in the rapidly accumulating . Moreover, there are Internet companies have realized profits of billions of years , and some stock market value has more than part of the bank . Left bank of the space and the odds are with the passage of time . </p>
						<p class="step"> Second, increase Internet resource inputs </p>
						<p> Currently, many banks are still enjoying up to 20 % of the net assets , and the Internet is the future business growth . With a cash cow business support growth businesses , which is the strategic management of a very simple conclusion. At present, banks still have enough financial strength to compete : if a home is about a year in a large increase in investment on the internet financial 2,000,000,000 , which will reduce bank profits only less than 1 %, but enough to form a significant advantage ( while Ali Baba [ microblogging ] 2011 all operating expenses and only 47 one hundred million ) . In addition, commercial banks also has a huge customer base , if customers can mobilize these companies joined the bank 's Internet platform , it is expected to significantly strengthen the cross- border network externalities . </p>
						<p class="step"> Third, establish more independent organizational structure </p>
						<p> Electricity supplier from the people's livelihood , land and gold in the organizational model point of view, this approach is worth other banks to follow . This architecture First, solve compliance issues , making room for future development are no longer limiting the scope of banking business ; second is to solve the problem of conflict corporate culture ; three may exceed the bank appraisal and compensation system, providing more effective incentives. Even within the banking system continues to be placed , Chinese banks should be reduced through greater authorized banks both cultural and appraisal, compensation constraints of the financial sector of the Internet . </p>
						<p class="step"> Four , the repositioning of the brand image connotation </p>
						<p> In the past, the majority of domestic banks brand image is not prominent, which is more negative publicity on the network . To the lack of a high degree of overlap recognizable , two more than the fashion sense to sedate bad, not three-dimensional and three plump , these will affect the target customer base Internet marketing . As most of our banks are highly homogeneous LOGO : red, blue or green circle . </p>
						<p> LOGO The high degree of homogeneity reflects the effect of multiple causes , Chinese banks not unique. This seems to be motivated by a concern: Once you have selected a certain personality , it means to give up part of the market . But the fact is that the business model would not want to, no one banks are not in all market segments have won an absolute advantage, and not to give up on the market in the external investment of resources , it is impossible to expand the core target market advantage . And in the Internet field , nothing special even meant to be replaced. </p>
						<p> If domestic banks for comprehensive changes to the brand image , LOGO and brand connotation misgivings , it is entirely possible to consider another alternative , that launch Internet banking sub-brands . This sub- brand can not only have a new LOGO, slogan and brand image, but also try to launch the mascot and even fixed brand ambassador , so that brand building fuller perspective , the ultimate goal is to significantly strengthen the attractiveness of the target customer groups . </p>
						<p class="step"> Five , with full respect for the spirit of the Internet , follow the bilateral market business model </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1, The establishment ? independent domain . In the new sub-brand , the bank 's Internet platform should be adopted to facilitate the dissemination of independent domain . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2, Pages organized according to customer needs . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3, Stimulate unilateral network externalities . Whether evaluation, credit ratings , forums or other forms , banks should be possible for customers to communicate directly or indirectly, between the creation of convenience . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 4, Open to other banks' customers . We do not think this area there are technical or regulatory issues , good financial business , cross Bo , have already achieved this functionality. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 5, Where possible , could be considered with other banking institutions to establish Internet banking alliance. </p>
						<p class="step"> Six , specialization and segmentation </p>
						<p> If you can not compete in the general-purpose platforms to become major players , banks can choose some market segments and areas of expertise . For example, some of the industry chain to build trading platform , which can largely avoid the competitive pressures. Such as Ping An Bank ( 13.47 , 0.78 , 6.15% ) and eBay [ microblogging ] cooperation is also very important choice. </p>
						<p> All in all, the Internet banking finance to bring both challenges and opportunities . Lack of knowledge, sluggish banks in the future will face increasing competitive situation of distress : platform construction latecomer disadvantage increasingly difficult to reverse . For success to grasp the trend of Internet banking banks, channels of contact with the customer the ability to significantly enhance its credit risk management, operational capacity will continue to benefit from big data technology to help them dig small and micro loans and consumer credit business these blue ocean opportunities. Current Internet banking competition has just kicked off , we can hardly judge the outcome of winning or losing the middle of the battlefield . But the Internet provides financial historic survival of the fittest and a screening mechanism for the banking industry , generally speaking such a mechanism would be more market-oriented banks favor. Of course, if their strength is insufficient, the selection and platform-based electricity supplier enterprises, the industrial chain of embedded development may well be a mutual win-win development model. </p>

						<p class="step"> P2P definitions and pattern analysis </p>
						<p> P2P (PeertoPeer) was originally a computer network concept, referring to the Internet information between peer entities interact . In 2005, there should be a way to use this kind of information exchange to lending companies - by the enterprise to provide a platform on the network , so that the supply and demand of retail loans to exchange information and facilitate transactions . After that, the model has been in rapid promotion , the achievements to Zopa, LengdingClub, Prosper and other enterprises. Subsequently, the modes into the domestic , the core model is a demand for loans and borrowing needs of the people through the interaction of supply and demand information platform for enterprises and deal, platform companies in the whole process of providing a range of support services and receive services fees. Online P2P. It is defined as : to rely on financial intermediaries between borrowers and lenders through the Internet does not provide intermediary services for the promotion of lending transactions. </p>
						<p> Although P2P is the essence of private lending , it is a loan category. However, compared to the average private lending and bank loans , has its own characteristics of students , mainly in the following four areas : </p>
						<p class="step"> Relationship flattened </p>
						<p> Compared to traditional private lending , P2P is the biggest characteristic point , the ultimate capital supply side and the demand side of the final funding to establish a direct relationship lending , capital chain is shorter, flatter lending relationships . This has two advantages: first , many of the lending relationship does not exist , the final capital supply side may get a higher interest rate , the demand side of the final funding may obtain funds at lower interest rates , increased borrowing inefficient ; Second , there is no relationship between participation in lending credit intermediary , without due credit intermediary funding strand breaks and triggered the entire lending system risks. </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/66.png"/>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/67.png"/>
						<p> Figure 1: P2P compared with the general pattern of private lending </p>
						<p class="step"> Information transparency </p>
						<p> P2P network based on the characteristics of the second as an intermediary , the transmission of information can break through time and space constraints, which results in the most direct result is that the information is relatively transparent, both lenders and borrowers matching efficiency , brokered shortened. Also, information can be transmitted directly between borrowers and lenders , fewer trips to the intermediate links, to avoid information distortion in the transmission process . </p>
						<p class="step"> Of credit finance </p>
						<p> P2P lenders lend money to finance the needs , which is the development trend of private lending in recent years . In a traditional bank lending relationship, depositors funds in the bank , in order to save money , in the traditional folk lending relationship , most lenders out of kinship , geopolitical relationships or karmic relationship lend money , lend money the first purpose is to maintain the relationship rather than capital appreciation . The P2P is not the case - both lenders and borrowers to build relationships through the network , the lender 's purpose is to add value funds are actually borrowing as a financial tool. </p>
						<p class="step"> Interest rate market </p>
						<p> P2P interest rate determined by the two kinds of ways , one in the case of secured lenders to get interest rates determined by the secured party , the borrower to pay the lender 's cost of funds equal to the gain rate plus the risk premium ; Second, in the case of unsecured borrowing rate determined by the auction both lenders and borrowers . Either method for determining the interest rate market funds are the true price response. </p>
						<p class="step"> P2P classification </p>
						<p> Fact , P2P financial disintermediation is an extension on the Internet - as intervening party platform , not from a lender to borrow money at , nor make loans to borrowers , but only in the intermediary business , in fact, of the banks' deposit and lending indirect financing converted into financing. Because of this, the lender's risk is mainly derived from the borrower's credit risk. In other countries, personal credit information system and enterprise credit system is relatively complete , the lender can query the borrower's past credit information roughly determine the counterparty credit risk. While in the country to determine the risk of the loan this way is shame. In order to facilitate transactions , and some intermediate platform for the introduction of a third party guarantee , usually by a professional security company provides the borrower with joint liability guarantee , so , P2P can be divided into two categories: secured and unsecured mode mode . </p>
						<p class="step"> Secured mode P2P </p>
						<p class="step"> Mode Success Stories </p>
						<p> Domestic security model than the unsecured mode P2P started late, but since 2012 to develop rapidly. This model is representative of Ping An Group 's Lujiazui Financial Exchange ( hereinafter referred to as "land of gold in " ) the "steady earnings - An e credit ." Its mode of operation as shown below : </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/68.png"/>
						<p> Exhibit 2 : Miss Kim 's mode of operation of the chart </p>
						<p> Ping Ping 's financing guarantee is dedicated to Lu Jin as "stable earnings - An e loan" business joint liability guarantee of professional -financed guarantee company . It depends mainly on project appraisal , a guarantee fee to maintain operations . According to the different project quality , ranging from the level of security companies guarantee fee charged by the lenders through Lu Jin Suoping Taiwan interest paid to the lender is certain - currently are 40% of the benchmark lending interest rates go up . In fact, in this mode , the borrower is equivalent to only get a risk-free rate . </p>
						<p class="step"> Mode Analysis </p>
						<p> Guarantee P2P mode has the following characteristics : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Credit risk assumed by the guarantor </p>
						<p> Traditional private lending , counterparty credit risk assumed by the lender , even with the security measures , counterparty credit risk is mainly assumed by the lender itself . And in the security model in P2P , assume the credit risk of the borrower is not primarily the lender , but the guarantor , many trading platforms provides that " all WINNING - An e credit guarantee companies owned by China Ping assume security responsibility if the borrower failed to fulfill the repayment obligations , guarantees the company will not repay the remaining principal and compensatory day off to all interest and penalty should not also be paid in full . " </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Risk premium non- lender enjoys </p>
						<p> Because the borrower 's credit risk is primarily borne by the warranty , so the risk of the loans are paid mainly by the secured party of all , not all lenders . In fact, P2P security mode , regardless of how the project risk loans , lenders usually only get a fixed interest rate , the loan project risk premium at floating guarantee in the form of fees or service charges by the normalization of all insured parties . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Operation mechanism similar to the savings and loan business </p>
						<p> Because such models guarantor generally quite strong ( as Lu Kim are actually a subsidiary of a large financial group ) , after the guarantor of debt secured joint and several liability generally do not allow lenders have suffered losses - the lenders risk is very small, all the risks are concentrated in the guarantor body - if only in this way , this model is similar to the bank's deposit and lending business , the lender is equivalent to bank depositors guarantor equivalent to a bank , the entire operation mechanism similar to a bank deposit and lending business. This leads to two consequences similar : first , P2P borrower 's risk appetite attribute is similar to the customer's risk appetite bank property ; Second , P2P platforms including guarantees the company's operations platform , no longer a mere intermediary party , enhance operational risks . </p>
						<p class="step"> Future trends </p>
						<p> P2P after the introduction of the guarantee , the occurrence of a very large change. We expect that in the future, will be secured p2p mode changes in the following areas : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> From retail loans to wholesale loans </p>
						<p> Traditional P2P, the main use of the field in the retail loans - this feature is largely confined to the lender different perception of the project , to make the judgment whether the loans not the same, not a single project bigger loan amount , and the lack of the necessary risk control measures in order for investors to diversify risk , had to limit their amount of investment in a single project . And the introduction of a strong guarantor to solve this problem , do not rule out some wholesale loans , project loans , especially the use of the P2P mode , online fund-raising - of course , the security company 's audit of such loans may be carried out online . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> From private lending to banking </p>
						<p> As already mentioned , the security deposit and lending business model P2P has similar , if such business continues to expand , will require that institutions and guarantee agencies platform standardization and institutionalization of improved operating level , which is may make it more similar to banking business , and part of the top of the platform and guarantors , it is possible to become China's first virtual bank (virtualbanks, only provide online banking services ) . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Platform for large-scale institutions and guarantee agencies </p>
						<p> In addition, because the volume of business expansion, especially in the wholesale business of all kinds of P2P institution 's competition, will actually spend a lot of capital - in order to prove their ability for these loans guarantee. The consequences platform bodies and security agencies need to reinforce their capital strength and expand their sales side , the rapid development of the industry , big is not inverted (tobigtofall) the rule will apply , the institution's large scale will be inevitable. </p>
						<p class="step"> Mode impact on banks </p>
						<p> P2P mode guarantee greater impact on banks in the capital side , because there is strong guarantees , capital investment in the supply side will find little risk , deposits with banks and financial products compare like with like - which is significantly higher than the income of P2P above two types of products. In the interest is not fully market-oriented case, banks should improve their competitiveness , we must rely issue financial products, while financial products has been " No. 8" and other restrictions, not all debt investments in non-standard , so at this point , the greater the impact . Distribution from the customer point of view, new rich people , younger age groups are more familiar with the Internet because , relatively high degree of acceptance will be subject to greater impact. And these groups , it is the low starting point of financial products, bank investors and target customers. </p>
						<p> The asset side , the P2P lending standards lower than retail banking standards , it is in the field of retail loans , banks have been hit much . But in the field of wholesale loans , P2P develop future , while P2P approval quickness claims against the bank's non-standard financial compete . </p>
						<p class="step"> Unsecured mode P2P </p>
						<p> Unsecured mode provides information intermediary services - namely providing information platform , the borrower will be funding needs information on the network platform, the lender after the decision to invest in access to information , through the network platform recognizes an associated relations , and through third-party payment platform to complete the allocation of funds . It should be said , this pattern is most conducive to the stability of lending platform </p>
						<p class="step"> Mode Analysis </p>
						<p> No independent security measures </p>
						<p> Risk guarantee companies imprest account the role looks pretty , in fact, is completely different , specifically in the supply side from the capital , the scope of protection , sources of funding , such as failure conditions and legal nature five aspects . Although the risk reserve account can play a role in risk control , but not in the typical sense security measures , their efforts to protect the lender is also smaller . </p>

						<p>Addition, intermediary business services and guarantees provided by the platform , which could run on the platform in a dilemma : If the emphasis on business , the risk reserve account is likely to be exhausted ultimately affect business development ; emphasis on risk control if , it is possible to increase the borrower's financing costs , and ultimately also affect the business - in fact , this model should belong to two companies will provide this service as an enterprise to provide the platform for corporate pricing power , internal controls are put forward higher requirements . </p>
						<p class="step"> Loan interest is fully owned by the borrower all </p>
						<p> Measures such as capital guarantee scheme can not fully assume the credit risk of the borrower , the majority of the credit risk is still borne by the lender , so the borrower to pay interest on all of the property of the lender , the platform company risk compensation by the lending fee commitments . All interest on loans owned by the lender , the loan will result in different rates is not the same - this is actually the borrower , lenders were made by market segmentation, high risk tolerance lenders and borrowers with poor credit corresponding riskier loans , low risk tolerance corresponding credit lenders excellent low-risk borrowers and loans , which helps to improve the efficiency of the entire platform . </p>
						<p class="step"> Platform operators risky </p>
						<p> Currently, unsecured and secured mode to mode competition , the majority of the principal protection scheme introduced mechanisms . For business development , part of the P2P platform more radical institutional exhibition industry , the implementation of non-performing loans accommodation claims , far exceeding their capacity . Even, some no principal protection planning mechanisms platform , but also on non-performing loans for payment. Increased benefit payments platform allows institutions to further desperation , these have increased the platform operational risk . As gifted easy credit , Aetna excellence, public lending network , urban and rural credit , a number of public network platform for credit institutions came tumbling down . </p>
						<p class="step"> Future trends </p>
						<p> Experienced closures in 2012 after unsecured P2P model is in the development of the industry in transition . We believe that the future development of the model will show the following three trends : </p>
						<p class="step"> Emphasis on safety of principal </p>
						<p> This demand is mainly given by the investor . After a P2P platform for bankruptcy , investment down the drain , investors pay more attention to the safety of investment - secured mode the rise , such as the principal security schemes to promote the use of such measures are a direct response to this attention . Expected that this will be more emphasis on the company's attention by P2P platform , forcing it in the design of the product when investors pay more attention to safety . Early on, this may be more emphasis will be reflected in the product structure , while in the latter , may be transferred to the borrower's credit standing up . </p>
						<p class="step"> Internal governance structure </p>
						<p> Focus on safety not only to focus investment security , more importantly, pay attention to the safe operation of P2P platforms . Currently, the network of financial regulators have been incorporated intentions, market requirements and regulatory intervention in the case , P2P industry may establish their own corporate governance structure and internal control system and risk control system standard , prompting the industry to optimize the internal governance structure . </p>
						<p class="step"> Industry usher in a restructuring period </p>
						<p> The agencies focus on the principal security and internal control process, the regulatory authorities involved in the network of financial conditions, now is not very transparent operation of unsecured mode P2P will usher in a restructuring - - risk control ability weak , internal controls loose , aggressive business ideas company may be out of the market , while the risk control ability, strict internal control , sound business ideas will eventually win. In the meantime, some investors may suffer losses . </p>
						<p class="step"> Mode impact on banks </p>
						<p> Customers due to commercial banks and financial customers are generally risk averse , while unsecured mode P2P higher degree of investor risk appetite , there is no guarantee on bank deposits P2P mode and Money has little effect on these two retail businesses . Its greatest impact on retail banking should be a stock fund distribution business , a collection of trust products promotion business. From the asset side, the interest rate because this mode is completely determined by the match between borrowers and lenders , do not rule out higher quality of retail loans to borrowers in order to facilitate borrowing P2P as an alternative to bank loans . </p>

						<p> PRADA flagship store in New York . Each garment has a RFID code . Whenever a customer picked up a PRADA into the fitting room , RFID will be automatically recognized in the dressing room of the screen will automatically play models wore this dress to go on stage video . Who saw the model , it will subconsciously beautify themselves. </p>
						<p> Meanwhile, the data will be transmitted to the PRADA headquarters. Every piece of clothing flagship store in which city which is what time to get into the dressing room stay long , data are stored and analyzed. If you have a clothing sales is low, the past practice is a direct kill . However, if the RFID data returned by this dress although sales low, but more often into the fitting room . That could explain some of the problems . Perhaps this will be the fate of different pieces of clothing . </p>
						<p> Luxury they use cutting-edge technology is not reasonable, and in the unexpected ? </p>
						<p class="step"> Two </p>
						<p> Thailand has a can accommodate 5,000 people at a time restaurant. Quite large. Its menu like Beijing Yellow Pages , very thick , just China 's Sichuan dishes, there are three categories . If a small restaurant , you point Mapo tofu and cooked pork , two dishes almost simultaneously on the table, you will not be surprised. But in this Thai restaurant , if you point the Japanese and mapo tofu, is almost the same time on the table, the taste is very authentic . You have to surprise . </p>
						<p> How to do it ? </p>
						<p> In the kitchen . There are a lot of cooks from different countries . Each chef has a display screen in front and tell the chef to do now that a dish. You eat Japanese food and Mapo Tofu is made ​​up of two far apart , perhaps, simply did not know two chefs do it . </p>
						<p> Same time to ensure the two dishes , the system will automatically calculate , if Japanese cuisine takes 1 hour and 10 minutes Mapo Tofu . That system will be the first time informed the Japanese chef cuisine, while at 50 minutes after notification Chinese cook tofu . To make two dishes almost simultaneously released. </p>
						<p class="step"> Three </p>
						<p> Have a bank call center . Operator also has a computer screen in front . Above line . Appear in the point above this line indicates that the user can generate sufficient profits for the bank . This line appears in the following points , which means that the user can not generate sufficient profits for the bank . </p>
						<p> When a call comes in , you say , another one bank gave me a 50% discount to me to be its users . The operator will see the user's screen that point in which position . If located in the following , the operator would say: Well, then cancel your account , I wish you a pleasant journey . If you are at the top, the operator will say : I told client manager to discuss , and we will give you a bigger discount , please stay. </p>
						<p> Call center is a profit center . </p>
						<p class="step"> Four </p>
						<p> UPS from the courier industry into the financial sector . </p>
						<p> Traditionally, a parcel sent from the manufacturer to the warehouse receipt by the user , in the middle required bank guarantee . Only when the user acknowledgment of receipt , the money will be paid to vendors . And usually it will spend two weeks time . </p>
						<p> UPS manufacturers can tell , I do not need two weeks , but only need two days to put the money to pay you . Vendors will be happy. UPS has been able to do this, because it is the first one to know the goods are sent , receipt of goods by the user . Typically , UPS pick up the goods to do the first action is to scan the bar codes. UPS delivery to complete the last action is done scanning barcodes. </p>
						<p> With financial services. UPS in the express industry advantage will be further deepened. And UPS also more than a revenue and profits. </p>
						<p class="step"> Five </p>
						<p> Taditional business model must be a second election : either meet the breadth or depth to meet . For example, pharmaceutical manufacturers to meet the breadth of one kind of cold medicine can cure all colds. Family doctor is to meet the depth , a physician only for a small number of people providing family counseling services. Can not have both breadth and depth . </p>
						<p> But the technology will change that. Genomics will allow large pharmaceutical manufacturers can meet the depth , but also to meet the breadth . Because they can provide to each patient individually customized for them with their own genetic code, genetic medicine . </p>
						<p> Media as well. Microblogging only meet the breadth of information for all, but also meet the depth of information that everyone is not the same , personalized . Moreover , regardless of their breadth and depth exceeds all previous forms of media . </p>

Wait until the garment production listed out on the street has been wearing pirate costumes. Nobody interested in these clothes . This is a blow to the fashion industry . </p>
						<p> But ZARA rely on a strong IT system to solve this problem. ZARA boss is now the richest man in Spain . </p>
						<p class="step"> Seven </p>
						<p> Than the business implications of scientific and technological innovation greater extent , is a social problem . </p>
						<p> And the uneven distribution of population aging . By 2050, Russia's population will shrink 33% , Italy 40% contraction . Middle East population will grow two -fold. The first time exceeded the number of older youth . </p>
						<p class="step"> Eight one thousand people die every hour and water pollution -related diseases. </p>
						<p> 2000 years after the birth of the child , the average life expectancy is 120 years old. </p>
						<p> Many European countries will go bankrupt . Because they did not expect a large increase in human life . Before they are in accordance with the average life expectancy 80 years to develop insurance and welfare programs . But these people want to live for 20 years , everything has changed . </p>

						<p class="step"> Two , the German " Direct Banking " development features </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( One ) Mostly by Bank Group Holdings </p>
						<p> Germany's " direct bank " mostly Bank Group 's wholly owned or holding subsidiaries. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Two ) Flat organizational structure Germany's " Direct Banking " </p>
						<p> Aspects of the organizational structure set up , fully embodies the "direct" features. Most banks have little or no physical branch network , the bank backstage staff to communicate directly with end customers and business contacts. With similar asset size compared to conventional banks , " direct bank" employees are generally less per capita amount of assets and deposits and loans per capita than the average conventional banks is much higher.

						<p> German " Direct Banking " primarily for individual customers to provide standardized financial products. Restrictions on the way the business process , " Direct Banking " It's hard to provide customers with personalized financial services. Currently, the German " Direct Banking " provides the following services : demand deposits and transfers , savings deposits , consumer installment , online trading , credit card business , securities investment, real estate financing. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Four ) Fully rely on the virtual network and external entities networking platform </p>
						<p> German " direct bank" business development is mainly based on the Internet platform , most financial services are available through the Internet to achieve. In addition to relying on the Internet outside of the virtual network , " Direct Banking " will actively use other physical units of the network channels to handle the business. For example, in the course of depositor account , " Direct Banking " real-name system for depositors and account review is the help of the post office network channels across the country , entrusted to the local post office operating room to complete. In addition, in order to meet the needs of customers cash withdrawal , only the individual larger " direct bank " set up their own automated teller machines, banks such as ING Direct , while most of the " direct banking " are outlets by means of other financial institutions ATM cash withdrawal to meet customer requirements , they are either adding ATMs Union , such as " cash- group alliance " or " cash pool alliance" , or is able to provide customers with free withdrawals VISA or MasterCard credit card . </p>

						<p> Because they do not establish physical stores and branches , and the " direct bank " can be the cost savings and expenses to help customers , so that customers get more " affordable ." " Direct Banking " The main way to attract customers to rely on the following : First, the savings for the customer to pay higher interest on deposits , usually up to 2 times the traditional banking entities -3 times or higher ; Second, do not charge the customer's bank account management fees and credit card annual fee ; Third, many banks have new clients worth about 50 euros to send gifts or gift certificates , and some banks have opened accounts directly send activation fee ; Fourth, many banks offer free withdrawals in the global credit card , convenient for customers to travel ; Fifth, the implementation of " customer change customers ' marketing campaigns , new customers and old customers to open an account in the recommendations were obtained after a successful reward points or gift ; six through some portals , e-commerce websites and other marketing activities for banks to this attract customers </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Six ) Pursuit of convenience and security of unified </p>
						<p> Compared to traditional banking entities fixed working hours , " Direct Banking " can use the Internet , mobile communication and other ways to provide customers 365 days 24 hours non-stop online financial services, which provide customers conduct online transactions and payments provides a great convenience , but " direct bank " is usually a 24-hour service hotline for customers in the online trading and account management problems encountered to help. On the other hand , the " Direct Banking " attaches great importance to network security and confidentiality of information , the client transfers and online payment, are set up multiple safety barriers , such as personal password authentication , transaction code (TAN) authentication, electronic passwords and so on. German " Direct Banking " has been committed to providing customers with convenient services at the same time , maximize the protection of customer funds . </p>
						<p class="step"> Third, the development of China Direct Banking Inspiration </p>
						<p> Present, although internet banking , mobile banking, telephone banking and other marketing model has been widely used in Chinese banking sector , but in China there is no one true meaning of " direct banking ." From the German " Direct Banking " development process and the operating characteristics of view, " direct banking " business foundation in China produce and technical conditions have been met. With the demand for enhanced financial innovation and financial control policy changes , China's banking sector is in a period of profound change and transformation , " Direct Banking " in Chinese banks are expected to complement each other with the entity as a new banking business model and become Bank Group and regional banks an important choice for business expansion . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( One ) The popularity of the Internet as a " direct bank" opened up broad prospects for development </p>
						<p> Before the advent of the Internet and the popularity of the German " Direct Banking " has been in a slow growth phase. Until after the close integration with the Internet , " Direct Banking " was able to achieve a historic leap and explosive growth. Therefore , it is no exaggeration to say that the Internet is the "direct bank " development "booster" for its survival and development opened up a vast space.

In addition, the scale of rural Internet users has continued to grow, reaching 106.81 million , accounting for 27.8% of total Internet users , an increase of 26.3%. </p>
						<p> The "Report" also noted that the business transaction type applications, the fastest-growing user base , average annual growth rate reached 68%. Among them, online payment users increased 80.9 percent , ranked first in all applications . 2009 China 's online shopping market transactions reached 250 billion , in 2010 net shopping market will usher in greater development . According to the " 2009 China Online Banking Report " shows that in 2009 China's electronic banking ( including online banking, telephone banking and mobile banking , etc. ) on the counter transaction overall replacement rate of over 40%. Can be expected, with the rise of a new generation of information technology and mobile Internet era, electronic banking banking entity replacement rate will further increase . Chinese Internet penetration and development both for the " Direct Banking " The emergence and development in China has created very favorable conditions, but also the financial business innovation put forward higher requirements, and the "direct bank " in China 's emergence and development will further promote the prosperity of China's online trading activities . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Two ) " Direct bank " can be a banking business development and regional expansion of the important ways </p>
						<p> Currently, China 's main joint-stock banks and numerous small regional banks are actively seeking business development and regional expansion. However, growth in the size of these banks have been impossible to replicate the original four state-owned commercial banks implemented nationwide layout mode , but must be developed model innovation and change. German " direct bank " gives us an important lesson that can take full advantage of modern information technology, with the virtual network and the external physical network , to get rid of the shackles of physical outlets and regional restrictions , a nationwide fast layout , attract customers, set up a business . " Direct Banking " generation in China already has the following advantages : First, the popularity of the Internet , people on the Internet-based e-commerce and online transactions is no stranger to online banking payment , securities trading, fund financial , insurance and other forms of purchase has been implemented really into people's lives in , is conducive to the "direct bank " in China 's creation and promotion ; two large commercial banks are now "online banking ", " telephone banking ", " mobile banking " and other services has been relatively mature , many of small banks also build their own network platform , therefore, from technical preparation point of view, the main Internet-based " direct bank " to create conditions have been met ; three are foreign " direct banking " After decades of development , has formed a sets more mature business model, there are many experiences and lessons learned can learn from China's banking sector . Of course, " Direct Banking " in China 's emergence and development , there are still some obstacles , such as China 's interest rate controls more stringent, the inter-bank interest rates can not be differentiated competition . As another example, China's banking sector must work vigorously promote interoperability , or " direct bank " would be difficult to share network resources existing financial institutions . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Three ) Highlight the " direct" feature , to provide customers with secure preferential timely financial services </p>
						<p> " Direct Banking " focuses on " direct" , that is, banks backstage directly with end customers to establish business relationships, providing financial services. Therefore, the " direct bank " must rely on modern media tools , relying on the existing financial network resources, at minimal cost , to meet customer demand for financial products and services , increasing returns of scale and decreasing marginal costs , thereby creating more value . " Direct Banking " services provided to customers must demonstrate safety , concessions, timely features. First of all, security is a " direct bank" lifeline . If the public to " Direct Banking " branded " unsafe " label, then the " direct bank " certainly can not survive and develop. Secondly, the " direct bank " to be able to provide customers with more favorable than traditional bank financial products , otherwise it is difficult to attract customers. Third, the " direct bank " to break through time and space constraints, to provide customers with timely financial services , reflecting the advantages beyond traditional banking entities . </p>

						<p> With cross-border e-commerce policy becomes clearer , foreign trade had become the third-party payment acquiring business company Blue Ocean . On the one hand , the company headed by Alipay began to aggressively introduce foreign brands to enter Taobao ; the other hand, such as the Orchid Pavilion and other export electricity supplier through the United States market to expand its influence abroad . </p>
						<p> " We think the latter greater market space , which is related to the status of China's current trade surplus , foreign trade and therefore we will focus on acquiring market, export-oriented electricity providers according to Business Department statistics caliber, in 2015 China's foreign trade volume will reach $ 4.8 trillion , and give to B2C ( business-to- customer ) is calculated according to one percent had $ 48 billion of market capacity .

					<div class="zz">Author：admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published：2013-11-19 13:26:00</div>
					<div class="xx">
						<p> Third-party payment means have a certain strength and reputation to protect independent non-bank institutions , through cooperation with the commercial banks , bank payment and settlement functions , based on the government , enterprises, institutions units to provide a neutral and impartial personalized for its user- pay settlement and value added services. With the emergence of electronic commerce , third-party payment industry as a new trading platform, experienced from scratch , gradually growing year development history , has formed a relatively complete industrial chain structure . Pay channels , pay diversified media and the Payment Application advancing trend . Especially since 2010 under the regulatory system since the Chinese third-party payment industry in which the policy environment, market environment has been greatly improved, third-party payment mechanism is ushering in the golden stage of rapid development . </p>
						<p class="step"> One, third-party payment amount and payment transaction size </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( One ) The number of third-party payment license issued survey </p>
						<p> From May 2011 to pay the central bank issued the first batch of licenses so far , a total of 250 enterprises to obtain third-party payment license . July 6 this year , including the payment Pioneer Pioneer Financial Group , Baidu and Sina subordinate pay per PayPal payment Sina 's 27 enterprises approved by the Chinese People's Bank's latest "third-party payment business license" , which is the sixth time the central bank issuing third-party payment license . Is expected to the end of 2013 , the company obtained a license payment will reach 260 . </p>
						<p> Third-party payment institution is allowed to provide non-financial institution payment service specifically cover the currency exchange , Internet payment , mobile payment , payment of fixed telephone , digital TV payment , prepaid card issuance and acceptance and bank card acquiring seven major business types . Divided according to business characteristics , we do business is licensing a comparative analysis : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Two ) Third-party payment market size </p>
						<p> And payment policy to encourage the efforts of enterprises and innovation , China's third-party payment market is growing rapidly , the market turnover showing a growing trend . 2012 Chinese third-party payment market transaction size is 12.9 trillion , compared with 2011 maintained a good growth momentum , the growth rate was 54.2% , and we are the market trends in the coming years remain optimistic, expected market transactions in 2016 will reach 51.8 trillion . </p>
						<p> Latest release of " Chinese payment and settlement industry to run the report ( 2013 ) " is the first third-party payment types for specific business transactions carried out detailed statistics . The report shows that in 2012 China's Internet payment service 10,456,000,000 total value of 6.89 trillion yuan ; mobile payment services 2.113 billion total value of 181.194 billion yuan ; payment institution to become a single market, the traditional closing an important supplement to deal with acquiring business 1,519,000,000 pens, amounted to 3.75 trillion yuan ; prepaid card business volume remained stable overall , 119 payment institutions prepaid cards issued 392 million , the amount of 57.555 billion yuan . Data show that , in addition to acquiring bank cards , Internet payment transactions and other traditional business scale continued strong growth, emerging businesses such as mobile payments also showed rapid development momentum . </p>
						<p class="step"> Two , third-party payment market competition </p>
						<p> domestic third-party payment after years of development , has achieved Internet payment , prepaid cards and bank card acquiring other business layout. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( One ) Internet payment market </p>
						<p> 2012 , the money paid through Paypal and individual clients in its exclusive advantage to the foundation for the development of C2C platform , occupying 67.5% of Internet payment market share ; UnionPay with similar service providers unmatched brand and influence among the top three market share of transactions ; relying on quick money online direct marketing , and actively develop value-added services in the market was active , living in the fourth ; ChinaPnR industry professional road walking , focusing on aerospace payment solutions program , the market share ranked fifth . </p>
						<p> Statistics show that last year, the Internet payment market , industry concentration ratio CR1 and CR5 index were 46.60% and 91.60% , indicating that China's current third-party Internet payment market industry concentration is very high, nine over 90% of the market share of five trading enterprises occupy third-party payment , and Alipay showing dominance trend. We believe that this is due to third-party payment has typical characteristics of bilateral market and network effects , the more users , the greater the value platform , and thus prone to " winner takes all" market situation. </p>
						<p> Internet payment area "oligarchs effects " may affect the trend of the entire industry , for the large number of lower market share in terms of third-party payment platform , it is probably because of the profit model with a single and qualitative competition in the Internet payment market suffered the fate of being shuffled . </p>
						<p> However, we still observe the market for third-party payment industry demonstrate sufficient enthusiasm : Suning , Jingdong and other electricity providers have stepped layout third party payment market ; Air China, Hainan Airlines and other central enterprises to use its Group business resources and government resources, the establishment and development of the independent payment company ; Sina, Baidu and other Internet giants and Pioneer financial Group and other private financial strength have also recently force, and get the latest batch of Internet payment license third-party payment scramble areas . On the one hand , major companies to join the industry is conducive to the rapid development and growth, on the other hand , after the farewell barbaric growth , companies received licenses to conduct market through aggressive expansion , but also the increasingly intense competition in the industry . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Two ) Prepaid market </p>
						<p> Multipurpose prepaid cards can be subdivided into corporate welfare card and personal prepaid cards . The main purpose of the establishment of corporate prepaid cards is to solve employee benefits and corporate tax avoidance ; individuals mainly from the prepaid card payment convenience or economic point of view and set up , including the public cards and membership cards . Citizen card mainly led by the Government , trade barriers is higher. Membership card is its economy to attract consumers, so cardholders enjoy merchant discounts , such as travel cards , Taobao reputation cards, etc. At present, the market participants less potential. </p>
						<p> " Chinese third-party payment industry research report ( 2013 ) " data display, 2012 in our multi-purpose prepaid card market, Lianhua OK and resources and the letter of the market share breakdown national two, Smart , HNA prone , Accor e card and the card will be ranked market One third to sixth place. Prepaid card market with the more obvious characteristics of regional differences . Beijing , Shanghai and other places started earlier, has been formed in a number of local influential leading brands. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Three ) Bank card acquiring market </p>
						<p> Our current bank card acquiring market , UMS , with its inherent advantages and administrative monopoly rights to occupy the largest market share. Communications to pay , fir Germany , remittance world , quick money and other enterprises to implement different development strategy, in 2012 the market share increased significantly. </p>
						<p> From industry concentration look, first-tier cities consumer businesses basically been monopolized by UMS , while second-tier cities consumer POS merchants lower coverage . As a bank card acquiring business CUP highest market share , competitive strategy adopted in recent years from a small business perspective, and second-tier cities as the frontier , to cultivate the domestic market acceptance . </p>
						<p class="step"> Three , Third-party payment Future </p>
						<p> Fast money announced its entry into cross-border payments market continues to expand into new market segments ; ChinaPnR continue to root out the aviation market while actively compete in the B2C market , and publish "Asi @" strategic new markets for mobile payments Highlands . After the license era , third-party payment companies have begun to market competition strategy of differentiation . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( One ) Combination of online and offline </p>
						<p> Businesses and individual users demand showing a trend of diversification , the mainstream type of third-party payment company's business gradually from online to offline . </p>
						<p> In 2012,ChinaPnR aimed prefecture-level city located in the following small businesses, small and micro- businesses and the self-employed in these industries long tail , the bank card acquiring business to avoid the mainstream banks and CUP competition seeks differential positioning . Long tail market by economies of scale, the face of massive trading and clearing funds , refinement process , the remittance a job can handle the volume of business is a traditional financial positions of nearly 10 times. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Two ) To expand value-added services </p>
						<p> With increasing competition, acquiring business profit margins are compressed again . To credit and supply chain financing as the representative of the financial value-added services , third-party payment industry will become another new profit growth point. </p>
						<p> Fast money , represented by a third-party payment companies have tried to participate in local SMEs liquidity management , payment and settlement platform, relying on information technology , creating a trade payables financing " Factoring "mode , the formation of liquidity management solutions to help businesses obtain and optimize cash flow. It is predicted that in 2012 the total money fast money handling capacity will reach 4 trillion yuan . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Three ) Cross-border payments </p>
						<p> Current mainstream third party payment companies in the education, public utilities payment and insurance , stocks, funds and other financial products in the domestic payment area pattern gradually stabilized. 2013 global electronic payment transaction volume is expected to reach $ 1.6 trillion , cross-border online shopping , B2B trade market has become contested new heights . </p>
						<p> TenPay commence with Cybersource, Asiapay other transnational co- payment service providers to quickly grafting global business resources , to provide users with comprehensive cross-border shopping payment solutions . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Four )Mobile payment </p>
						<p> According to incomplete statistics , in 2015 China mobile payment market transactions will reach 712.3 billion yuan . Has always been of concern to the industry of micro-channel version 5.0 unveiled , this claims to have 400 million users of social software coming into TenPay financial payment , derived from micro-channel payment functions . Tencent will pay for future system will be further extended to more platforms , the new mobile phone QQ and micro-channel will introduce mobile payment functionality. </p>
						<p> Third-party payment market is a promising areas, service lines many forms , impossible a situation of dominance . With the platform, the deepening of trade services , third-party payment provider 's products will gradually showing travel alienation and professional features , the industry gradually into a virtuous circle. </p>
						<p class="step"> Four , Third-party payment security considerations </p>
						<p> From the payment gateway , payment platform to provide payment and settlement services , third-party payment business scope expanding , model innovation , evolving platform framework , which are third-party payment security put forward higher requirements. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( One ) Credit card cash , money-laundering issues </p>
						<p> To solve the problem cash , Paypal and January 9, 2012 released the " close to the PayPal account to pay credit card recharge channel announcement ." From February 8, 2012 from close to the PayPal account to pay credit card recharge channel. Saying Alipay online consumer credit provides a fast payment, online banking and other payment methods , advised consumers to shop online payments directly to the merchant . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Two ) Account funds theft , phishing problem </p>
						<p> Currently widely used by third-party payment platform technology security measures - a digital certificate , which is not really an independent third-party CA certificate , but the internal construction of a line with the actual requirements of the certificate registration audit system , however, this digital certificate has no legal effect . </p>
						<p> Various platforms are used SSL protocol protect the underlying security , real-time monitoring of risk only in the implementation of Alipay . Technical security control, operation and maintenance technology sector depends on the input . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> ( Three ) Financial security of third-party payment platform issues </p>
						<p> 2010 "issued by non-financial institution payment service management approach " clearly " prohibits any form of payment institutions misappropriation of clients' excess reserves ", and online payment, prepaid card issuance and acceptance other money transfer services placed under the statutory management areas . " Balance treasure" Innovation although belonging to fight supervision " edge ball " behavior, but also for third-party payment processing organization precipitation funds provide a useful way of thinking.

						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/55.png"/>
						<p> Remember a month ago Alipay statement do ? "Due to some reasons known to all ," Alipay claims to want to stop all line POS business. At that time I also regret for a long time , because he did not brush off Alipay POS machines, they will disappear. However, in the October 1 , cash on delivery , when I use the Amazon , found here are still using PayPal POS, then quickly covered up the small ticket look like Minato articles. The result, not finished article , news and updates : </p>
						<p> From dual 11 online shopping festival time draws near , it is learned that the " double 11 " consumer cooperative entity store in some consumer generated through the " Alipay POS machines " paid and included this year the "double 11" in sales. This also means that previously quite understated Alipay POS machines will be "double 11" big push into retail stores. ( Taken from titanium media ) </p>
						<p> This year, the capital of the words really can not believe ah. About Ali refused to choose that thing listed in Hong Kong , I advise everyone to understand by this idea . In short, I feel like "World of Warcraft " in a story called the Scarlet Monastery , you finally Kanfan a brawny , not move suddenly , out of the back of a beautiful woman shouting " Resurrection, my warriors ." . So stand up and shout along brawny " fighting for you , my lady ," waiting for you to continue and then cut again. </p>
						<p> Put on POS machines Alipay material refreshed , this article attempts to answer the following three questions : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1, Paypal POS machines in the end is what ? </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2, Alipay POS machine business in the end want to do ? </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3, In which the role played by the CUP ? </p>
						<p class="step"> one , Paypal POS machines in the end is what ? </p>
						<p> Below is my October 1 brush to Alipay POS small ticket , please be patient phone slag quality . </p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/56.png"/>
						<p> Can see that acquirers are Paypal, credit card issuers are the credit card I brush the issuing bank (COMM is cross the line ) . Although this is to buy things on Amazon , but Amazon in the small ticket did not occur. Business name is very strange, is cash on delivery. Back more than a logistics service provider 's name, I just swipe from courier clerk hands getting goods . </p>
						<p> This small ticket merchants the most important information is the number: " 999-1610-5411-0002 ." I can help you put different meanings of numbers disconnected , and we look forward from behind .
						<p> "0002" Nothing special meaning, is serial number. </p>
						<p> "5411" is the business type (MCC), this figure represents supermarket category . We have a credit card and preferential points is this number section decided how much to pay commission merchants also decide this number . Such as hotel rates high than the supermarket , so we often encounter Hotels unwilling credit card , supermarket similar situation a lot less . </p>
						<p> "1610" is the city code, this figure represents Taiyuan, Shanxi Province . Insert the hard Canton : As the largest province of the earth heritage of this land 5,000 years of Chinese civilization has a reputation in Shanxi , Wutai Mountain , Monastery, Shanxi compound are worthy to walk around . Good environmental governance in recent years , at least, much stronger than before . </p>
						<p> "999" is the main event , this represents acceptance merchants . If UnionPay POS machine business is 001 ; if workers and peasants in four rows POS machines , it is 102,103,104 and 105 , respectively . Then the 999 number this domineering supreme Alipay CUP points to do ? Of course not, Alipay POS machines they not use the CUP network , build their own networks of course want to choose what code no problems - and the 001 and 999 is really very well matched pair yet. </p>
						<p> you please recall Alipay claims never to POS machine business news, with explicit reference to Alipay in a self-built settlement network in parallel with the Union do ? So many news look down , anyway, I was feeling was not to Alipay CUP POS machines with their own networks. </p>
						<p> Again, Alipay CUP POS machines did not go clearing network, but self clearing network , which determines the Alipay in the end want to do. </p>
						<p class="step"> Two Alipay POS machine business in the end want to do ? </p>
						<p> To make it clear this thing , you need to thoroughly understand the relationship between CUP and UMS . </p>
						<p> CUP, CUP card can be understood as develop standards and establish clearing agency networks . Such as a bank card , beginning with 62 , printed on CUP LOGO, and then in the same UnionPay logo printed on the ATM machine withdrawals can be a . CUP shareholders are various financial institutions , we know the names of banks are basically shareholder. With the official said, " China is the China UnionPay bankcard association , UnionPay inter-bank transaction settlement system through , the commercial banking system to achieve interoperability between and resource sharing , to ensure inter-bank bankcard , inter-regional and cross-border use ." </p>
						<p> UnionPay he will not go to install POS machines ( strictly speaking called acquiring business ) , which is a subsidiary of China UnionPay business doing things . Since UMS is UnionPay own son , is not it dominate the world ? About Alipay do before POS machine business news, very vague to say UnionPay account for nearly 90% market share - this statement is wrong. First of all, do POS machine business is not UMS CUP ; Second, it contains 90% of all commercial banks acquiring business share. 2011 end of the line acquiring business , the UMS 39.4% 44.8% Bank ( data taken from iResearch report ) . </p>
						<p> At this point, you can understand Alipay POS machines want to do , right ? CUP is the standard-setting bodies , there is a pro-son UMS . PayPal and China UnionPay business goal is not competition , but their own and establish a parallel clearing UnionPay network - deliberate pro-son , is that they have to when Qindie . </p>
						<p> Back to the beginning that " some well-known reasons ," UnionPay in the end what kind of role play ? </p>
						<p class="step"> Three , in which the role played by the CUP ? </p>
						<p> Do not worry first criticism UnionPay monopoly , we UnionPay 's reaction is divided into two areas: the first aspect is not considered right or wrong, only consider UnionPay do too, but fire ; second aspect does not consider the effect , just do not fit together to consider the CUP moral arena . </p>
						<p> Regarding the first aspect , Paypal self trading network is severely POS machines CUP poke in the sore spot directly under the ruthless hand is definitely CUP Kill forced rhythm. Previously mentioned, UMS has been able to rely on a monopoly CUP , CUP card depends on the CUP card transactions and clearing network . Now leading Alipay online payment build a line to separate clearing network , if successful , it is online or offline dominate the political arena , the future is not completely CUP what happened. With such a ratio , only to engage in ruthless Ares 360 Tencent QQ and Baidu search , this situation before the opponent can not tell you your life hell, where also spare means pretty ugly . </p>
						<p> Regarding the second aspect , although UnionPay as standard-setting bodies and Alipay strained very ugly , but still just use their CUP cards and clearing network to restrict their opponents , such as UnionPay cards only take UnionPay trading channel , CUP trading interfaces allowed illegal use . And these tricks to deal with offline marketing still a little effect , for the Alipay online market has been by far the effect is difficult to say how much - there is Ma in the People's Bank does not stand on it . These tools and the Internet circles compared to battle hard to say more do not speak the moral arena . Recall that as a legal cashier Lynx Taobao Alipay it, in order to protect the so-called users, Baidu can not search , micro-channel can not be generalized , the other third-party payment can not intervene , espoused same logic is "my site to listen to me ." </p>
						<p> Furthermore , we do not take UnionPay class or classes SOE SOE think bad. Ma and Alibaba have special approval ran around to different policies , the absence of owners of state-owned enterprises are not directly related to the interests of the beneficiaries , although they are not particularly good for the user great power , but also have little incentive to deliberately pondering the user a pit , you know get into trouble , but will be higher and the Responsibility of a veto event. Daisha stupid and have bad eye is completely two different things . </p>
						<p> Ultimately, UnionPay as a standard-setting organization and networking of the referee , the problem is set up UMS own fate when the athlete . Bank card on the same common "VISA" and "MasterCard" are honestly do network , no two take-all . So, if the accused UnionPay monopoly , should promote CUP peel UMS , good as a focus on standards and network industry organizations . </p>

						<p> Compared with the past fifteen years , the last few years the Internet market is changing very fast , how do we strain ? Let us go back a few times ADMINISTRATION most Assembly: last "5 • 18" upheaval after a seven-year itch , organization structure made ​​considerable adjustment ; late last year we also raised the quality strategy ; the first half of this year, management cadres of passion and curiosity and openness requirements. In this time management cadres and the General Assembly , we will adhere to the basic principles of the past year and a half , it is going with the "build quality , embrace the mobile Internet " is a very clear trend. </p>
						<p> Face of this trend, the last two years gave me a feeling that we like going back 15 years ago, burning passion , I found we did for 15 years, starting from scratch to build tools , platforms, no business model from a product , and gradually , gradually grow into a rich business model. Scratch overthrown, so again , this process is very exciting . </p>
						<p> For all of you , today is a good time to allow us the opportunity to do so again , this process is easy to find life very difficult , and I hope we can have a more urgent mission sense ! </p>
						<p class="step"> From Sogou of the Union , to see change mentality </p>
						<p> And then look at the recent relatively large movements. We recently Sogou reached a strategic alliance , which Tencent is never done , part of our business is to "marry " out, and a former rivals together, as one . This matter has still not fully integrated completed, after all, is Tencent not done . </p>
						<p> Why does everyone think very sudden ? Because quite complex , many competitors in this field , so any leak could cause the whole thing done. This thing ends too soon , everything happens in less than a month, the real implementation of only two weeks , even for General Office , is 2,3 days in advance of all communication with the head office only . The whole thing is a miracle that we actually feel more secrecy , because the age of the Internet is difficult confidential. </p>
						<p> Because Tencent had never done such a thing , for many employees is a big shock, many do not understand , it was a loss. First, from the general direction of view, this is the right thing , we should do . But how do we do ? How to make a corporate culture Tencent spiritual concerns of employees can continue ? From another perspective, for the search line colleagues , cadres should have a more open mind , in fact, not far from home , you can be understood as a partner assigned to , or branch office to work, I believe that the future talent can still flowing . We still have to have an open, go up and down , can retreat into that within just outside the relatively healthy state of mind . </p>
						<p> This time is not only a search for the line, I believe that its business segments, cadres will certainly inspire , Tencent what can be done ? I believe many of my colleagues would think after this many problems . This is from the "5 • 18" after another in the entire organizational structure organizational relatively large changes , it will surely bring some thinking . </p>
						<p> Ago, many of my colleagues will complain , the company a lot of things that change, but became too slow, indecisive, and too many things to consider . Unchanged, as the industry's Nokia , BlackBerry and other companies to the last how about ? Dragging , dragging one another quarter final or not, the process is very tragic . We hope that in this volatile industry, we must take the initiative to change, should take the initiative to recruit , there are problems resolved quickly , dragging three months, six months , a year , it will slowly become, who could not save . So this mentality we have to unify , when executed , when they encounter problems , we have to hold firm confidence, more positive look at the problem . Initiative to change often better than static, helpless. </p>
						<p> Just said , mobile Internet industry to go, this is the trend , because of the situation we want to change, we continue from the internal organizational structure, from product concern , from past PC , the phone is relatively separated state toward reunification . "5 • 18" Then we do a lot of adjustments, but not enough , you also need a lot of adjustments. </p>
						<p> For example, recently we have secure mobile security and PC integrated in one , on the MIG. Behind this , we see MIG several times after the surgery, began remodeling MIG 's core mission , management cadres re-planning duties. Now in terms of security , the entire defense are on the MIG, which is the focus of the company , but also for the entire next decade, Tencent mobile Internet business model escort, which is very , very important. Can not have any luck let you slow a slow , or not to think , the challenge we have to keep in mind in mind . All product lines should actively think about how to bring the share of security , how to enhance the security of professional competence and image, which is the question I hope you will never want to deny no peace . This is the history of mankind identical national and regional development , there is no difference , safety is always live, work and business development. </p>
						<p class="step"> Cadres to "hungry " , not wealthy </p>
						<p> Changes in such circumstances how can our people win the battle , how to go better ? It is important for the request . We mentioned to have passion , to learn, to open up , I will not expand , I want to say is that from a very intuitive feel , we very much hope that the atmosphere of the entire management of cadres is very hungry . </p>
						<p> To solve these problems, as you really want to own things at home , have a very urgent mission possible can. If we say that ten years later, many of my colleagues joined the company a very long time , and slowly , slowly, "skin" , it should proactively give the location of the next generation of more proactive teams or cadres to lead the team up . </p>
						<p> Some business is not doing too good, looking back is not a question of money , not money or resources did not give enough , it is critical or team spirit. Especially with the team's generals very important , there really are incompetent generals feeling exhausted armed forces , the following colleagues will be very disappointed that the company is making a lot of things Why so slow ? Why did not find the problem ? If it continues for six months, a year to see the change? </p>
						<p> This case, we see that there will be capital-intensive traditional industries the opportunity to reverse , but the mobile Internet is very unlikely , because the market is not a fight for money , nor is it to fight money buy traffic , more is to fight the team , there is no mission, there is no sense of urgency , there is no good way to solve ? </p>
						<p> I wanted to break the concept of wealthy past , we hope to become Chuang generation , create the second generation , the resource will give you , so that everyone's starting line is good, but ultimately win not win necessarily depend can you make a boutique at , is not it bE THEBEST? We offer a lot of resources to give you just add, others products are 100 points , you are 80 minutes, I can only give you the resources plus 100 points , the first one or two years of your score more than others, and if five years after it, 100 5 th over 80 to the fifth power plus 100 , prolonged time to that point you add resources to be negligible , and ultimately rely on the quality of the product itself can be compared with others , it has been repeatedly demonstrated . </p>
						<p> Therefore, we hope to refresh the past a lot of layout. Many very large share of the business , colleagues hope the following tube more and more, what are hold , which requires rethinking , 10 are not as good as a very weak . Otherwise, do not pile things up , only minus points , distracted . </p>
						<p> Back may also have a lot of changes, including our products must strengthen Review, really want to make a decision we have to cut bad , Guantingbingzhuan . Some businesses do their own previously , it may be transferred to investment firms, as long as he does well , then holding shares 30 %, 20% can be transferred to him, and not necessarily all are placed in their own hands . </p>
						<p class="step"> Internal potential , streamlining </p>
						<p> Finally , we hope that the number of employees is more streamlining . Recruited more than 1,000 graduates this year , the total number of growth control in less than 10% growth next year controlled within 5% . I believe that from a lot of projects will make a lot of manpower , everybody internal potential , do not say I did so , I do not want to move, to keep people or idle to find projects to do , rather than a true departure from the essential requirements . This turned the allocation , we have the bigger picture , it should Fangjiu Fang . </p>
						<p> Course, from the historical point of view , this thing is never easy , you need to Push, even clinging to perform only way , I hope everyone from the future to really start thinking about this question , the more people are not better, who is the denominator , the results are molecules , we see the final effect is not good . Plus every individual, every one carefully selected people who can truly greater than the average of an original , or less than 1 , then the rate of increase and never more than one , always great but a pattern is difficult , it is difficult to reverse the . </p>
						<p> Products and services can pick up ? Front boot process is very, very important. I almost never seen in history has not been a sudden not to the last line of products . Beginning to show confidence in the team , to show CPU speed than others , if you are fine , and finally add something positive is possible , otherwise low speed stuff is always added after drag - which is quite a big reflection, I hope to share with everyone , I hope everyone in the company after proper adjustment and respect this principle can be more resonance. </p>
						<p> Hope that we can embrace the mobile Internet , mobile Internet and the PC Internet will be together , we do not despise PC to the Internet , because we have a lot of business models, including the team , infrastructure , financial background, many of them as one ! I hope you will embrace more open , especially the inside open , a lot of cooperation within the team in fact there are many areas for improvement. Because industry specializing in surgery , and some products and categories is very good at many of my colleagues , I hope everyone can actively open mind we can work together to get things done , Hello, everyone is really good ! </p>

					<div class="xx">
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/70.png"/>
						<p> Ma's true face has always been based on the name of charity and opera singing utilitarian walking the lakes . </p>
						<p> Crazy pass Ali to enter the banking sector , this is big news. Significance of this news is that : Ali with several banks are not sweet cooperation of line ends. Ma will be burning bridges . Bootstrap banner, smashed chains , open a bank , especially opening a new world of retail banking network . </p>
						<p> Zhexiang , Shenzhen penguin gulped several major carriers soup ; that car , Ma upcoming bank heist of the meat dish . </p>
						<p> But things are not so simple. Finance is what the concept ? Finance is the blood of the economy , finance is the industry 's crown. </p>
						<p> Baidu dead, few people criticize your mother a big deal , hugging Sogou, Tomorrow The Sun Also Rises . But a financial collapse of the company could trigger a chain reaction , the butterfly effect instantly fly all over the world , leading to global economic crisis. </p>
						<p> Internet companies may do financial business , but the question is do you make an Internet company ? Of course, if the license is resolved, Pandora 's box will open. </p>
						<p> Planing to novelty in recent years , back to basics and try to analyze financial strategy how to subvert the barbarians outside the city and torn existing orthodox bank . Simply rely on bank deposits, loans, risk management, several core elements survive, survive today. From the point of view of these elements , Ma has the possibility of victory . Let us analyze them one by one : </p>
						<p class="step"> One , deposits </p>
						<p> Deposits, the bank's blood , is the foundation. Deposit is not strong, the earth was moving . And Alipay theory is that the flow of funds is large enough, the stock of this pool of funds is also large enough. </p>
						<p> When they use Alipay transactions AB , A to start trading capital Paypal , from Paypal to B, the middle of a process resides . The payment of treasure , this is a blood transfusion, blood in the process , when a large transaction staggered when the book will lead to Alipay certain amount of money out of thin air retention . </p>
						<p> This depends on the amount of capital turnover , the average time of completion of the transaction , has fluctuated , but data prediction . Moreover, meaningful only average , occasional accidental fluctuations through the central bank's discount to solve, do not need to worry. When Ali's daily trading volume hit a new high again and again , in fact , Alipay can remain stable on the book are bound to the same cash becomes astronomical. </p>
						<p> Paypal, you can come out of thin air so many deposits, but low interest or even interest-free deposits. Do not rush to thank balance Treasure Cock wire provides hundreds of millions of financial needs , in essence, just Ma just need more money , of course, price is not so high paying a market rate . </p>
						<p> Ma victory. </p>
						<p class="step"> Two ,loans and risk </p>
						<p> Banks depend on loans to make profits , but the loan risk, bad debt rate has been an important indicator of bank risk control , which is the top priority of the Bank's work is difficult. </p>
						<p> Difficulties ? Commercial banks to provide loans to enterprises , remove collateral, the bank can roughly judge from the enterprise 's property master data . But the risk is still difficult to accurately predict , because the bank up to understand the flow of funds of enterprises , more detailed data bank information is invisible . </p>
						<p> Therefore, the traditional means of collateral and guarantees is just moving bricks , that is, banks moved a seemingly locked into their own fly brick vaults , and then how much money reckon the value of this piece of brick , whereby a person to borrow money lenders only. </p>
						<p> In this sense, the risk of bank loans with the bank on the loan is actually the size of an object is inversely proportional to how much information to understand . </p>
						<p> Contrast, rely on the accumulation of years of massive data warehouse data , Alibaba network operators not only mastered the flow of funds data, but also master the details of the entire business operations . It is expected that , Ali doing banks, risk control is inherently superior than traditional banks . </p>
						<p> Traditional banking technology content is not high compared to moving bricks , Ma do is look in the mirror , that information through data matching and screening mirrors to illuminate whether you have lending capacity , willingness to repay . Precise drip irrigation technology to ensure people can borrow money to borrow the money needed , but do not spend money . </p>
						<p> Ma conquer. </p>
						<p class="step"> Three , credit and rating </p>
						<p> Credit is clearly the basis for electronic commerce . Similarly, the credit is the financial foundation. In other countries, there are some companies specialize in credit ratings , but in China , it seems not, of course , there may be , but these are a credit to the company itself is worth a good suspect . From the year as Chinese Premier Zhu School of Accountancy erected four words , " do not do false accounting ' expectations , it is clear that China will not get the S & P and Moody's . </p>
						<p> Measure of credit , it is actually about how much information to grasp . Can even be absolutely said that the information asymmetry is the root of all the contradictions , the less grasp of the information , the higher the risk , the higher the cost of financing , the credit rating company's birth , in fact, in order to reduce financing costs. </p>
						<p> Financial industry has always been a collection of information , extract information , relying on information acquisition profits of the industry. This logic suggests that if China will produce an influential credit rating company, then Ali is the maximum possible . </p>
						<p> If the ability to use information and assessment of credit capacity is relevant, Ali undoubtedly clinch . </p>
						<p class="step"> Four , credit card problems </p>
						<p> For commercial banks, credit cards are a source of income , but for Paypal , credit cards of significance beyond the scope of traditional credit cards . Payment convenience is often the decisive factor in e-commerce . </p>
						<p> Electronic banking is complicated , mainly because of security considerations . However, the evolution of bank card is also advancing with the times , not only with the dynamic password , I recently found that banks with World of Warcraft to learn, actually have a secret security card , all in all, are the basis of security in order to support more convenient electronic payment . </p>
						<p> Profit model , operating costs, customer base , information processing, risk control culture , value-added channels , sustainable development, the core of these decisions Vital banks have mastered the basic elements of Ali , and mastery of better . </p>
						<p> Stand in front of the barricade is nothing more than a few Ma : license was sufficient regulatory capital , the bank will understand complex talent electricity supplier , still can not compete with the bank risk control technology , banking wholesale business . However , as long as access to a banking license , the other as Tannangquwu , ripe. </p>
						<p> Now feared not that banks huddled siege Ali, worried that one day in Shenzhen and Hangzhou Ali penguin direct dialogue interpleader chief . I predict future Ali will merge several smaller banks , incorporating several pleasant lobby manager sister to delight Ali bank line experience . </p>
						<p> Retail customer base, online retail customer base Cock wire will become bloody Normandy . And banks as Germanic noble defender , died not too beautiful. </p>
						<p> Sesame are open , irresistible . </p>

						<p> Product manager put myself as a discerning user . We do product 's energy is limited, interactive content a lot, so to catch the most common one . Flow , where the largest amount to be taken into account. Specification to allow users to use the comfortable. To feel , touch on both wondering, there is confusion to think to improve . Such as the mouse moves less , you can quickly point to and so on. <p>
						<p> Do the design for the product is the most difficult set priorities and priorities . Determine the function of the quality of statistics can not write a report proved to be finished next flow . This is very wrong, we look at the user is not need this feature. So I hope that our products early in the product design manager wanted to get more plainly . Product managers need to devote more attention, attention is not the same , the outcome is very different . <p>
						<p class="step"> 1. Core competencies <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Any product has the core functionality , its purpose is to help the user to solve a particular aspect of the user 's needs, such as save time, solve problems, improve efficiency. <p>
						<p> Many product manager insufficient attention on core competencies , not to say that there is no concern , but no attention in place. Core capabilities only function , but also performance. Product manager for the technical background , especially backing out, if they have the ability and confidence to do the focus on core competencies , and will definitely eager to speed , the background to achieve the limit. But now the question was not well. Web page speed optimization for instance some time ago , a lot faster after optimization , really do not know what went before ? Allows users to endure for so long, only a waste of time and a waste of our resources . Do not grasp , nobody paid any attention , it can not be justified . So we have to put more effort in terms of performance . <p>
						<p> Comes to core capabilities , we must first have technical breakthrough. Such as making QQ video , we can not do some things people have I , or always came in second and third , although there are opportunities, but the lack of surprise when the first came out , it will lose the user's identity. At this time, you first want to focus on is your product hard. In the design and development time you have to take into account the outside world will compare it with competitors , such as the ability to play , take up memory and so on. Like QQ video , its core performance and speed are beyond STORM , so after the release will be a good momentum of development . <p>
						<p> Fixed target selection fact, there are many choices, such as network play, communicate , share , this is a good idea . But eventually cut off , we are to do the player , because it is the user's needs. Not everyone needs to HD , but high-end users need ( this will be mentioned again later to create word of mouth ) . Only hard targets met, users say , my broken machines , not put STORM , QQ video can be put . In this sentence , word came out that users know your line and reputation have differences. <p>
						<p> Core competencies to achieve the ultimate. To think about how to achieve differentiation through technology , and let people do , or by a year or so to catch up . <p>
						<p> Many users comments with QQ QQ , said the only reason is that transfer files quickly, there is a group . Well, this is our advantage , we want to maximize this advantage . Such as transfer files offline , by mail manifestation is a transit point, even large files is not difficult , the key is to do it. Although not necessarily true multi- use user , but the user will say, I want to transfer large files , looking for a long time can not find a place to pass , desperation used only poor QQmail, actually OK , so we reputation came.
						<p> Do great, you first have to consider is how to make people think of to catch up . So many years in the IDC (Internet Data Center ) We can not waste accumulation on high-speed upload, metro transit station to upload ⋯ ⋯ support high speed may well be the discovery of new issues , if not the message , in the IM (instant messaging software ) on how should achieve . Our aim is to make users feel fast, fast, allowing users to experience very good , which require substantial technical and background to match . <p>
						<p> Product updates and upgrades needed to meet product manager , but we do research and development , product manager came much. The products and services requires a lot of technical background , and we hope that very senior product manager , did the front end , back-end technology developed by R & D personnel promoted from. Handed a good product best technical capabilities , experienced staff on hand , this will make everyone more at ease. If the product manager failed , so many brothers accompany dry , the result will be found in the wrong direction is very wasteful and dampen team morale . <p>
						<p class="step"> 2. Reputation <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Word of mouth will do the product concerned to do high-end users , opinion leaders concerned about the direction . Previously, we encounter the idea is to meet most of the " white" needs of users. But now, the end users can get the feeling of the real word of mouth . <p>
						<p> How to enhance the end user's attention , this is the basic function of a better case to consider the issue . Such as e-mail search , RSS aggregation , but only the " flashy " user in the blog and forum which will be mentioned in the case that we have the ability to be guaranteed. In the case of products has been formed to treat high-end users do not have the same mentality . Such as allowing the user to use our QQmail another mailbox. Before the name of a small ninety-nine our own hearts , let others inconvenient to use an external email address, good use ours, but these small Hong, end users could see , so to get rid of , the only way to be truly user-friendly . <p>
						<p>Personalized service, not a popular service , but also to get word of mouth . <p>
						<p> A product in the absence of word of mouth , do not abuse platform . Such as IM ( instant messaging ) department for support , input marketing resources to marketing ( marketing department ) Contact PR advertising, advertising requirements ⋯ ⋯ mention more people cut , in fact, was thinking half enough. Our product managers allocate effort seems very well , 50% product and 30% marketing ⋯ ⋯ Of course, if you are in a basic link control well, so of course you can . But in most cases the first point of our people are doing well . If your strength and odds of less than 70 % to 80 %, then put the focus on the core areas . When your products have gained good reputation, are on the rise before considering these . <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Most product managers to pay attention to the core of the strategy to get the user reputation points , if this not done thoroughly, the result can only be a user over, disappointed , and then spend more energy to make , this is worth the candle. <p>
						<p> Grow automatically when the user ( users will take the initiative to recommend their friends to use our products ) , not going to bother the user , or it may be meaning but misguided . At this time , each doing one thing, each plus one thing must be very carefully considered , is really a constructive way to increase the product of a reputation. When a user reputation broken , the user then pull back hard . <p>
						<p> Increased functionality in the management and control functions should also have skills. After doing the core functions , commonly used functions is to gradually padded . Products at the local, small place of innovation requires insatiable . Have a good reputation as a product , plus one for each function should be considered clear that this function to 10% of users will bring good impression when 90% of users are confusing . When there is a conflict to be smart , Points avoided. Not have to use much each function is good , but with the people feel good is really good . <p>
						<p> Do product development when there is a strong need to develop mechanisms to ensure that , so you can make product development more agile and fast. Even large projects should be flexible. Can not say wait 3 months and then give you something to see , this time the competitors have run out already do not know how far . <p>
						<p> Developers to devote to think about products, rather than business-like attitude. You have to know the user , peers are concerned about your product, in which developers need to be conscientious driven to take the initiative to complete . Can not say that until the product is ready, to the front of the line to do the same . 40-50 % of the final product experience should be determined by the developer . Product officers do not envy some work for developers design , is the only way to participate in the team 's . Otherwise, the product will come out belated . <p>
						<p class="step"> Operational style management : Sensitive to find deficiencies <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Keywords : daily use <p>
						<p> Our products are not stand-alone version , users need not only a strong sense and technical skills , but more importantly is the service. We pay attention to some very complex content , such as architecture , applications , products need to have a better architecture , which takes a lot of energy , under normal conditions might not see, so we need to rise more from KPI ( key performance indicators ) considered . This is test of skill , and who do good, the General Office of the leadership is visible , good design structure will not hand chaos foot disorder . As the core of things made ​​of component modules distributed . <p>
						<p> Product is found deficiencies , the easiest way is to use your product every day . Product Manager only more sensitive to identify your product deficiencies. I often feel very strange , and some can not find the product manager said , I believe if the product is on the line when you're stuck for three months , the problem is limited to one day find one, get rid of , you will slowly approaching that . " great reputation , "the point . Not because there is no technical content of the work is not done , a lot of good products are relying on this method to do it . Our leaders not only to arrange the following people do, we must do it yourself. These are not difficult , the key is to adhere to , the heart must be thinking , do not try this weekend , definitely an accident, until the basic shape of a product . <p>
						<p> Place from which to find the problem then ? forum , blog , RSS feeds ah. Disdain for high-end users to the forum to ask questions , our product managers must take the initiative to chase out to check, go to search , and then take the initiative and user contact solution , some users really wrong , and some of our own problems. Mentality to be a good product manager , we want users to be able to identify problems and then resolved. Even the smallest problem solved also completed a major event. Some things do, bear fruit soon . Product managers to pay attention to many aspects of operations often go to see , for example, your product is slow, the user will not control your IDC (Internet Data Center ) poor or for other reasons , just know your speed slow. <p>
						<p class="step"> Interaction design : do the most discerning user <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Keywords: fine <p>
						<p> Product manager put myself as a discerning user . We do product 's energy is limited, interactive content a lot, so to catch the most common one . Flow , where the largest amount to be taken into account. Specification to allow users to use the comfortable. To feel , touch on both wondering, there is confusion to think to improve . Such as the mouse moves less , you can quickly point to and so on. <p>
						<p> Mailbox like "Back" button on where , put the right or the left , we have to many wondering how to put better think it over and then on-line testing. Letter to the same user , the user has multiple mailboxes in the case of how to use a default option recent account. These needs are small, but you really do come out , you would say well, although he may not be able to say what was good . <p>
						<p> Use of the product to meet the user's habits , such as writing e-mail when copying things, more people prefer to use the keyboard to operate. Although some technical difficulty, it can be resolved , interactive, feedback of the mouse sensitivity, convenience. <p>
						<p> In design, we should insist on a few : <p>
						<p> Not force users. If light icon , if QQmail, no disturbance of 1% 99% of the demand of the user. <p>
						<p> Convenience of operation . Such as QQ music , old and new lists, both have to take into account , such as a shortcut QQ video playback , from round to square , and finally abandoned because of compromising performance . <p>
						<p> Touch of art, point to the last. If QQmail, QQmail inspired in the UI interface , not too heavy can do it well. Design and simplicity is not a contradiction . <p>
						<p> Emphasis should be prominent, not deliberately cater to a younger age . <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Internet products designed " Ma rule ": <p>
						<p> 1, For the products entered into priority and priorities . <p>
						<p> 2, Without forcing users. 1%, not 99% of the demand for disturbance of the user. <p>
						<p> 3, Research and development mechanism assurance, product generation to be fast, fast implementation and rapid response . <p>
						<p> 4, Pattern and simplicity is not a contradiction . <p>
						<p> 5, To enrich their roles, make the most discerning user , stupid users. <p>
						<p> 6, Product manager first pay attention to the product 's hard. <p>
						<p> 7, Technological core competence stronger non- replicable , so that the ultimate core ability to generate word of mouth . <p>
						<p> 8, At the local, small place of innovation should be insatiable . <p>

						<p> Now we all know , the rise of third-party payment , making the payments industry competition is growing. In fact, personal feeling , technology is not a problem , mainly idea, you think, think of others before , then you are successful. Kaka Union began when I updated to 1.0.3 involved in evaluation , then to be honest, is not very optimistic about Kaka linked credit card payments . Although 1.0.3 highlights in this. I am not linked to pour cold water on Kaka , how to say no now Which party payment credit card payments ? Mobile side , Paypal, money paid through other third-party payment , there is the phone card class , and Kara , while interesting brothers about each stroke , a box of treasure and UMS UnionPay online payment card to pay so happy , too much. Say in the credit card payment achievements in this regard , it must be unique . Alipay can balance treasure repayment Kara can also Citibank, silver treasure box suppliers Shengjing Bank added that local commercial banks . Other people can not, so look terrible . Currently, Kaka Union should support the CUP online payment , some banks , personally think that is not unique . So in the future , in the next version, how should we do it unique , or that the direction of development , what is it ? <p>
						<p> Personal opinion, of course, is the recent popularity of 020 . We know that the phone card reader brought up a lot of trouble , and in 2015 the central bank requires rectification IC card , phone card reader can survive for long , I do not know, but there will be a bottleneck , that is, two o'clock , carrying the popularity of inconvenience and IC card replacement . Then the IC card magnetic stripe cards disappear over time , through the calculation of time , but also the NFC mobile phone over time, then the phone itself does not require any auxiliary financial equipment , it becomes a paid artifact. So now is to find the most feasible way to achieve a 020 on it. Feasible means of low cost , efficient and fast . So the cost of this point, perhaps Kaka Union is pioneer, be sure to seize the opportunity , or lose the opportunity , there is no any advantage point in time , that is, from now on ! <p>
						<p> We assume that it is now the era of single- chip cards over and over , then Kara class to pay the company would definitely be affected , but not like Paypal . Because it is online payment , online payment , but the disadvantage is that , although Paypal now has a huge user base, the base of Internet users are also huge , but it will use Alipay , or financial security of the network who have confidence in the proportion is not large . Alipay various bindings , this link is destined to a lot of trouble , how fast it fast payment , once the phone number for replacement or bank issues, many tied to the card is very troublesome . Cell phone down , code had not come , we need a great deal of time cost . Imagine a scene , a friend , inviting you to help him online shopping, he said he 's Carry money, how to buy . And he said quick payment and so on, totally confused ah , all right , we idealize it. We use the account to help him orders, payment options Kaka Unicom Road , enter my own phone number, and then we turn Kaka linked with their mobile phones , saw orders , payments, took his financial IC card , credit card, phone and handed he entered the password , get. Is it too simple ? Pair slightly, this is what we want to work towards it. Comes to 020 , making two-dimensional code , the next single , each with its own software, but pay channel , select Kaka linking, then shoot the card , you can directly succeed. This convenient , Alipay impossible, because friends and shopping, she was looking to use her card payment , which is not very convenient for you ? Rather than that she is very troublesome to get cash to you, because people may also like credit card it, that cost is not the same without you ? <p>
						<p> Flash merchants pay more and more, but I remember reading "and the excellent friendly" talks to the former Merchants Bank president Ma Weihua , when used for taxi drivers master flash or Alipay payment , Alipay drivers are generally expressed as pos to cost , Ma governor was also said that this is indeed a luxury car a pos . That Ay , we have a good two-dimensional code , but I beat myself on the phone card , no question it, do not pay your brother to buy flash pos, which can always be right ? <p>
						<p> Few days ago to see the CUP online payment "mini- pay " good, but the cost of learning is relatively high, RMB 218 , I would say so choose UnionPay online payment you can brush the IC card , and then just complain that Kaka Union doing , if you can access the CUP online payment gateway linking Kaka , why I want to buy this mini- pay ? ! Also install the driver and binding , so busy that an exhilaration. Talk mini- pay now launched itself felt not a mature product . Why, because it is 2013 , not over the age of IC card can be online why should I spend more money , ah, not computer people still headache. Kaka is precisely at this time associated cost savings , but did not pay this function, so at this point I think Kaka Union should also be aware of their own development direction of the bar ? Also, contrast mini pay and Kaka linking, in addition to people connected into the CUP online , the mini- pay is really no advantage . Another aspect that Kaka Union , is not the point of the article do electronic cash ? Currently , the central bank to promote the chip card , chip card , but mostly online transactions , offline transactions , and who are willing to Quancun electronic cash it, because a lot of places cashiers will not get the brush does not go out , ICBC 's lap to mention free , CCB and BOC , which do not mention support ring , or over the counter will be charged , then how to do, Kaka came joint responsibility . Octopus card I can choose offline or online , so Kaka linking to promote the popularity of e-cash . Oh, someone's home is currently impossible , to see you. <p>
						<p> Summarize it . Personal recommendations direction of development. <p>
						<p> 1, payment orders , generate orders through phone numbers , making card payment , hope , just hope , as soon as access UnionPay online payment channels associated with the formation of Kaka . <p>
						<p> 2, you can choose an offline electronic cash payment orders. <p>
						<p> 3, two-dimensional code 020 payment , the separate development is good , looking forward to the CUP online development is good. UnionPay online payment recommended to take a ride , UnionPay online payment plug-in for easy selection of mobile phones , " Kaka together" payment channels can be. <p>
						<p> 4, a direct challenge to the digital display financial IC card , electronic cash through the shoot Carla taking transaction details , not just balance inquiries . Line inquiry transaction details , reminder, this does not have to develop their own , with " UnionPay wallet ." After binding through CUP network can pull all the transaction details . <p>
						<p> 5, with the current requirements of the central bank , interbank Quancun technology implementation . <p>
						<p> 6, mobile recharge , UnionPay super transfer function and pay these very necessary function . As for what to pay a fine water, electricity , do not do it. Banks and third-party blinding vision of doing this , does not make sense ! <p>
						<p> 7, IC card to pay attention to the long-term extension application . Recharge Well , not only is electronic cash , if the financial expansion of the public transportation IC card application , then the application for the extension area opened Quancun recharge. <p>
						<p> 8, the main development direction and accurate positioning. Do not move the development of NFC-SWP card wrong direction , Kaka is ultimately the formation of joint mobile pos machine , not to say that the formation of the card to paste another pos, while the mobile NFC payment , focused on the phone into financial IC card , or extend the financial IC card . Complementary relationship , the future is likely to form two-pronged approach . <p>
						<p> Are some of the features mentioned above involves consultation and cooperation CUP online here . I'm really saying CUP relatively silent department , a lot of branches . But it is recommended when the specified reference standards and interfaces UnionPay online payment , followed by the reference UMS . Otherwise, future development will be a great butt problem, do not give yourself unnecessary costs caused ! <p>

						<p> Tiger sniffing Note : Last week, we released on October 10 Ma Tencent internal speech at the meeting , " cadres to hunger , do not do second-generation rich ." Overall, Ma mainly from the cultural and macro strategies put some more. And today released this Tencent president Liu Zhi Ping 's speech , from a more specific level, Tencent is now summed up the layout of the current development of mobile Internet , but it will help us understand how the inventory of yourself and Tencent 's judgment on the industry . <p>
						<p> First like to ask you a question, yesterday returned to the room there is no impulse to fight aircraft ? Especially seeing Pony and Tony ups ? Remind one , too harmful to the body hit the aircraft , especially to the eyes is not very good , be careful ! <p>
						<p> A joke, I would say that we have entered the era of universal mobile games ! In this regard, I have a relatively deep feelings , the mobile Internet has the potential to bring 10 times our future possibilities , the feeling in the past few months more and more, especially seeing this sudden outbreak of mobile gaming , variable into the national game of the era. So today, I hope to further explore with you , in the past six months in the end what is the pattern of this industry change ? Our overall execution is kind of how ? What is the company's strategic thinking ? <p>
						<p class="step"> Mobile Internet Digital torrent <p>
						<p> First look at the total number of Internet . The entire Internet population growth remained at around 10% , but the growth of intelligent machines is doubled , volume has been close to 4 million . For example , the game this one , relatively slow growth in the past 1-2 years , growing faster this year, but some of the larger factor is the rapid development of mobile games . Again , the whole pattern of the portal slowly being subverted , so the portal advertising growth is very slow , and even some are regressive , which is seen moving tide in the subversive ; Also, search engines although the growth is very fast , but the growth rate decline compared with the previous year , and now support the entire growth is largely the RTM growth rather than growth of subscribers , from the PC to the wireless , wireless network throughout the search mode and not fully realized established subversion also appear ; addition, we see that e-commerce, online payment , with people living on the ever-growing trend among moved to subvert the extent not so high . <p>
						<p> Then compare our own data . First, that a social communications , the decline in the PC side , the growth of the mobile side is very obvious ; Second , the media this one , Tencent read the whole article and the entire amount of users on the PC side of the decline, but in the mobile side very, very fast growth , moving side than on the PC side UV UV; third micro -Bo 75 percent of the mobile side ; fourth , we can see the movement of the game relatively small amount of penetration , the the main thing is PC top tour players and mobile phones with severe hedging is not much , we believe that the mobile side is an incremental ; electricity supplier of the speed of movement is relatively lagging behind , relatively speaking, but not so fast mobility to us the electricity supplier has some chance , I hope the trend broke when moving or when we are the leader , or the time the entire electricity supplier system is ready to acquire the outbreak of dividends. <p>
						<p class="step"> Speed mobile Internet realizable <p>
						<p> Other big trend is the realization mode of the mobile Internet increasingly clear that the last meeting we said change existing some challenges , and now we see the realization of the growth rate is very fast. <p>
						<p> The development of the mobile Internet speed will be realized beyond all expectations , and will continue to accelerate . The first example , games , KaKaoTalk is the industry model , a quarter of the water in South Korea has been close to $ 200 million , occupied the whole of South Korean mobile game market share of more than 60% , which is very huge new market , Line In Japan the game is also very high incomes ; <p>
						<p> Second , advertising this one , Facebook in just one year 41% of advertising revenue has moved from the side last year, everyone is still in doubt whether it can move of the time , but in the realization of the side of the speed is very , very fast, but its share price yesterday, a record high , reaching $ 122.7 billion market capitalization ; <p>
						<p> Third , an electricity supplier which , in the absence of logistics mode trend moving very, very obvious, such as GroupOn, Amazon has the logistics of such a transformation is relatively slow, but you can see an annual increase of very fast growth rate of over 400%; <p>
						<p> Fourth , we can see a lot of O2O development speed is very fast, this hotel Ctrip mode mobile penetration rate is now 40% , 6 months ago mobile penetration is still less than 20%. <p>
						<p> See this situation because , in the past six months of the year , the major giants are very, very concerned about moving the entrance , so the acquisition of big moves occur again and again . Ali's strategy is to cast a wide net , the first placeholder , Ali did not like their products, so there is likely to be moved to the entrance of these companies take a very aggressive , occupying first the attitude of minority investment , involving Sina micro-Bo, GAO De- , UC Web; Baidu is a long time no action giant, it is to show the wolf, and on 91 , 19 billion dollars for the acquisition price , as well as PPS and sticky web ; 360 seems like soy sauce the same, but really want to UC swallow , with search dogs have a contract ready to be signed , the feeling in the soy sauce , but courage is very large. Tencent also a lot of action , we hope that the overall investment and acquisition strategy as an extension of the overall strategy , for example , you can see for the search , we hope that through investment and depth of cooperation, let us re- search in the reach scale , reforming the military capacity , on the road again . <p>
						<p class="step"> Where we are today <p>
						<p> Tead the entire market environment, so that we can look at our own past half year of implementation of the strategy is to move what ? <p>
						<p> We put the whole of China 20 highest DAU non- gaming applications on here, look at our accounting position. You can see the top five highest DAU application where we accounted for 3.5 . Why is it 3.5 ? QQ and micro-channel is leading ; half is the new marriage Sogou Sogou input method is the order of 70 million DAU , accounting in third place ; followed Qzone and 360 security guards . Our top ten accounted for 5.5 years , as well as safety steward and mobile browsers ; ago 20 we accounted for 7.5 , as well as news and information category Tencent QQ music . In fact, we have a lot of applications , microblogging, video , electricity providers have the opportunity to break into this list , can we have more products to accelerate mobility ? It is our strong hope that the next six months to do . <p>
						<p> From income , we continue to increase investment in mobile , but the mobile technology that gives us a short-term income is relatively small. From the income is very healthy for our growth , the game is 15 billion , an increase of 33% , the main driving force or side trips ; advertising this one more than 51% annual growth , one video, one is the wide point pass ; community has obviously been moved shock, because our entire system is still no real VIP grafted onto the mobile side , it is quite concerned about how this kind can reshape QQ, Qzone overall mobility competitiveness ; electricity supplier this one , self- electricity suppliers rapid development momentum can hope continue. <p>
						<p> If we believe that the future of this one can begin to move realized , we now hesitate to invest in the future , even if profits may be damaged , but we still need to do . <p>
						<p class="step"> Mobility under the new opportunities <p>
						<p> Looking to the future , mobile will bring us many new opportunities for us on the one hand to consolidate the existing business, on the other hand we have a lot of catching up new opportunities for business . <p>
						<p> The platform side of the micro-channel + QQ put our entire social and communication in the safety factor has a greatly improved , and allows us to reach 10-20 million that might have high-end users, these numbers may not seem a lot, but we do a lot of future business , especially with the media , electrical contractors and business related applications bring great future opportunities . WeChat so that we can sail , this is a whole new market space. <p>
						<p> Flow platform in this one , we see a lot of the wireless side of the new opportunities in the PC side is a late entrant , safety is very difficult, but in the phone side is forty-six open , in which a mobile platform for traffic our new opportunities. <p>
						<p> This is a industry : mobile game is a new opportunity to a large extent , mobile games are tens of billions of possible future market for us very, very important ; media on this side , we have seen a sudden we came in contact with many, many were not looking at our news and media information of the user ; investment search, an increase in scale , the other one is to scale can be extended to wireless Internet, let us have a better mobile Internet channel under better opportunities to gain market share in the circumstances , talk to produce commercial linkage system , which is wireless Internet gives us the opportunity , which is why we can impress Sogou cooperate with us ; also electricity supplier can not find mobile providers tips ? Let's move the field of electronic business can ride the wind to go through the waves . <p>
						<p> Numerous new industries , basically related to people's lives , the greatest service in the financial services , O2O. Look at the whole block of the world's largest companies , natural resources, real estate is a resource class, the largest service in addition to these categories, one is the financial , one retail , one is the media and entertainment. Based on the first round of development of the Internet , we in the entertainment and media that a whole good position occupied . Future Internet will certainly profoundly affect other industries, including financial services, retail services , so we have to think constantly want to have any chance . As Pony said, the mobile Internet has given us the opportunity to start a new venture , I hope we can use the very spirit to face. <p>
						<p class="step"> 1000 billion dollars under the sense of crisis <p>
						<p> Our performance was not up too much, but the momentum in the mobile technology under the company's share price rose this year was very, very powerful, September 17 our market capitalization exceeded 100 billion U.S. dollars. We know that many , many companies have this dream , but for many brothers who head office of the company , this is a best of times, in fact, is the worst of times , I felt my heart quite uneasy. <p>
						<p> Nokia has $ 200 billion of the company, all of a sudden 7 billion dollars to the most valuable business sold out ; BlackBerry, almost touched the 100 billion dollars, 90 billion dollars market value of the company is now also sold more than 40 billion ...... you can see , IT industry changes very , very cruel , 100 billion company decline is very, very normal thing , even to the one hundred billion higher when the opportunity to decline . <p>
						<p> Why ? First, the industry is very cruel ; more importantly, a big company , a company will be successful complacent , comfortable mood, would infighting . Before we are all together entrepreneurial team , uneven distribution of benefits begins after a fight on the inside , as well as bureaucratic and other issues. Traditional industries may not be so obvious feeling that we this new industry, the heavier the burden decline faster. So everyone should have a very strong sense of crisis, people outside to give you a lot of applause when this time is the most dangerous . <p>
						<p> All , we need to be prepared , strategic thinking , here , I do three strategies to share with everyone . <p>
						<p class="step"> Sogou strategic alliance Rethinking <p>
						<p> First strategic sharing is Pony just said search business , including our cooperation against Sogou , also represents the seven years we have done a search on the overall business thinking . <p>
						<p> Doing this acquisition , we will further intensify the search for investment, rather than let go ignored , the future PC browser , mobile browser, or other products and the new Sogou to this close partnership has a strong interaction, not to say that we retreat , but further forward, the whole play is not the same. <p>
						<p> Contrast Soso and Sogou, for reflection , why Soso is not made ​​in the past so many years ? Sogou resources are relatively scarce in the circumstances of our market share or 2.5 times what is the reason ? First , leaders very, very critical , there is no focus on the leader , all the time, effort hit the top, cadres can not united ? We know that our cadres wave after wave of this , there was no way to form a hard , everyone desperate struggle between state. Second , strategic thinking is critical that you are searching latecomer channels are very important , the browser is very critical path , there is no critical path , use a lot of resources Tencent finally come and go or no way to get traffic go up . Third , attitude, we have some wealthy feeling. One day Sogou people call me , inventory our server , our server is that it is three times the number , which illustrate some of the problems behind . <p>
						<p> We see "5 • 18" after the change , Soso has a great improvement , technological advances have been a lot faster , the team state or a lot . However, the entire market structure is changing, assuming 360 Sogou do not buy , we have willingness and ability to do it themselves, because the PC browser recently force good ; But suppose it after buying , the market share was 63 %, 28% , continue to do a search on the great difficulty . This is why we need to do a final inevitable choice , or else we have the opportunity to one-third of the world out . <p>
						<p> Frankly, if we can make a decision may not be earlier today , this is the General Office of the reflection. But all the same as when managers management business , when you see something not right time to make that change immediately , and so it tends to last out the results getting worse. <p>
						<p class="step"> See from two boarding business critical paths and cooperation mechanisms <p>
						<p> Second strategic sharing , we can see that there are two operations , one is a mobile game , a mobile media landscape in the whole big mobile phone QQ through micro-channel and boarding it. What are the critical path in the end ? <p>
						<p> Mobile games critical path is clear , in the micro-channel and two large mobile QQ platform has a game center , the platform can be used after downloading friend rank , sending hearts , reminding other SNS features led. Looks very simple, but we achieve this , the Executive spent nine months time, because all the platforms must unify their thinking , in the end who did ? How to do it ? When the critical path do you see the whole outcome of very, very large, very high registrations , DAU is very high. Such as rhythm master, this game has released ten months , the game is quite good, but less than 1 million DAU , after the release of this platform , DAU1600 million, which is the critical path amplification effect. <p>
						<p> Second is Tencent, the critical path is the beginning of the micro- news letter which made ​​a plug-in, is now the only remaining will install the plug-in, mobile QQ also put this system into them, as well as news plugin. Read daily news plugin amount of 280 million articles , news clients amount of reading 150 million over the past 10 years, we do PC Web results , within one year of wireless on over . <p>
						<p> Critical path have user value, if there is no user value, where to put a flow , where to put a flow of little value, organic style integrated better than inorganic type integration , a lot of things very simple, but you have to find a simple Road maps are ready to put the whole , very quickly considering the possibility of 100 , 90 brush , 10 of which elect three , the result is very simple, but after a very complicated , you just have to consider very thoughtful can be used continuously screening mechanism , making logical judgment before they can find a simple way . <p>
						<p> In this regard , we still need a better division of labor mechanism , in the end platform to do what business do ? If the platform and the business division is better, this power can play out . Meanwhile, we have a mechanism to the platform business model , sharing mechanism , the real return platform can also see results of their own efforts , so that sufficient incentives to the platform . <p>
						<p> Preconditions platform itself is what ? Platform itself should have an open mind , to have the spirit of trust , but their stuff inside the platform , the heavy stuff to give the business to do it . What things are taking on the body, increasing the redo is not good. Business precondition is itself have a strong professional competence , the game is already 10 years of cumulative market leader , the media also has 10 years of accumulation , you can not play good recruits . Change to the platform, while his own point of view , just let me do what platform benefits , which are complementary. <p>
						<p> Open and expertise of these two mutual interaction, empathy, we trust each other. With these followed by details on the critical path , you have a critical path then I can continue to iterate , for example , games that one entrance , UI, distribution mechanisms for how to do ? News is , put four , five , three , one push once or twice ? Lead what ? How stimulating introductions , the low success rate when downloading what interaction ? There are many , when you know how to find the critical path of the force , the team will do very high. <p>
						<p class="step"> Trip to Korea Inspiration <p>
						<p> Third issue I would like to carry out a strategic share is the total front office went to South Korea to visit Kakao and Samsung . <p>
						<p> Kakao just a few years to become South Korea 's most influential mobile Internet company , even the most influential Internet companies , their products are launched one after another , not to say that every one had been successful, but many months had been successful, including Kakao Talk, Kakao Story. Samsung is the other extreme , founded in 1938 , then the long history of the company, saw a few of their big battle , the waves have to spend 10-20 years. The industry is Japan and the United States, Europe specialized market, it is 1974 intervention , a step by step to do , from input minimum technical content of products , and now do mobile processor, a step by step to become the industry leader : television, ever felt this war is never insurmountable , but Samsung constantly build capacity , taking advantage of TFT-LCD technology changes , all of a sudden become the industry leader, in 2007 began after leader ; mobile phones, started in 1993 to 2013 to become a the highest volume , it took 20 years to make a career , to end up beyond ! <p>
						<p> Both are very successful company , very worth learning , but have very different contrast : <p>
						<p> Kakao Talk is a small team spirit. 450 people company, doing quite a lot of things , do things every time insight into industry trends . It is a good start to do a few different mobile App, later found communication is the most effective ; Then , find a good communication and social interaction, launched Kakao Story, also became a separate App, he felt that to each other linkage , that only a single application of insecurity ; finally make games, game downloads for sharing with the SDK pull , pull with social games - these are very in-depth thinking . Really do it , there are very strong executive power, to do it even if unsuccessful product market , its interface , relatively high level of interaction . In addition, it has a platform to throw to the other partner companies do not have to hold anything . <p>
						<p> Samsung's entire professional system of power is very , very strong , then the big companies be prepared . 1993 Samsung in South Korea is already dominate the political arena , but the founder, said all over the world to see Samsung's products are in the corner , very sense of crisis. In 1993 he organized the cadres opened three days and three nights will be , he spoke three days and three nights , which is the most famous speech , the purpose is to change everything , that " in addition to his wife and children , all things must change ." McKinsey communicate with them a lot, they said Samsung is indeed very eager to learn this business , you can see it after entering new areas , the process of catching up is not its first innovation , but you can quickly do a better job than others , then beyond - this thing is worth to follow. In addition , Samsung's operation of various systems , HR systems , strategic systems , they are not bound to use system services, but with the system to help businesses grow . If this spirit can really integrate into our management inside, which is very important to us . <p>
						<p> Finally, I would like to say , 15 years, Tencent is still very young , if you can really grasp the mobile Internet , the outbreak of the Internet entrepreneurial passion , opportunities may be 10 times before the PC to the Internet , and we hope the team can keep the passion , maintaining studious, let BE THE BEST!

						<p> The first two years after the third-party payment license issued to corporate customers mainly prepaid market environment is changing , prepaid card industry consolidation and restructuring is emerging . <p>
						<p> 09-08, has a nationwide license prepaid card issuance and acceptance of one of the Big Six Yu Fu payment CITIC Bank announced the launch of a joint credit card with the launch of its personal card brand - Choi card fully into the personal card market , started the prepaid card shot into the individual market sectors . <p>
						<p> It is understood that the current number of prepaid card companies are seeking transformation , ready to force the individual market . Yufu payment and other prepaid card companies are gradually changing our image of the industry . <p>
						<p class="step"> Joint credit card and prepaid card <p>

						<p> Yu Yu Fu Fu Group's payment is first to obtain a license third-party payment companies , the business scope includes Internet payment , prepaid card issuance and acceptance , after virtue prepaid " Foca " hot topic nationwide . <p>
						<p> Yufu Group co-branded cards in the series on the line , it is also an occasion to launch "wealth card ." Yufu joint credit card credit card can be directly converted to fiscal integration ; secret " money card " account balance can be redeemed in the online way back to a personal bank card . <p>
						<p> Industry sources said Yu Fordjoy card to find a combination of traditional financial and prepaid channels , on this basis , financial card also thought that the financial sector services , or third-party payment companies will lead to more follow-up . <p>
						<p> Choi Yu Fu payment card is only combined with traditional financial step , Yu Fu Group Chairman Cheng Chun broader market is still brewing . He said that in the future , subject to regulatory approval, will be launched around the fiscal card such as purchase funds, insurance , financial products and other financial services. <p>
						<p> It is understood that the Internet will also be paid under a force Yufu focus . Yufu own online store - Yu Fu Online has been opened . <p>
						<p class="step"> Individual Market: Prepaid blue ocean <p>
						<p> " Original business model is not sustainable in the long term , which requires us to make a change in the future prepaid blue ocean in the individual market ." Cheng Chun said. Hope that after two to three years of efforts, Yu Fu line prepaid market share to account for 90% of individuals . It is understood that information and belief, Gao Hui Tong and other prepaid card companies also fought in the individual market ready . <p>
						<p> Reported in the financial card, Cheng Chun also prepared a "Paul" "life" theme products , coupled with previous Foca , hi card , forming the traditional Chinese "Fu " cultural " Gods hi wealth" series . Cheng Chun would like prepaid cards this modern settlement tool as a carrier , to create a blend of Eastern and Western cultures and cultural products . <p>
						<p class="step"> Capital gains puzzle solving precipitation samples <p>
						<p> Has been prepaid corporate earnings sources mainly from four aspects: First card fees and management fees ; Second Merchant rebate ; Third Vending itself brings a lot of excess reserves arising from customer deposits interest ; four people because of outdated or abandoned Gouka caused residual , which precipitated capital gains issue has been heavily criticized . <p>
						<p> According to the relevant provisions of the central bank , the payment institution 's risk reserve provision shall not be less than its excess reserves bank account interest income of 10%. This means that payment institutions receive up to 90% interest on funds precipitation . Most third-party payment companies have this as a source of profit . <p>
						<p> " Money card " Another innovation is that the card balance integral feedback , Yufu Cheng led a capital gains refund cardholders will precipitate a third-party payment companies . <p>
						<p> It is understood that Yufu payment is based on the return of credit card balance of 4% for an annualized return , the return points on a monthly basis , a 4% return ratio than the current 3% of the one-year deposit interest is also high. <p>

						<p> Cheng Chun believes that if payment companies depend only on the interest and commissions, profit margins will increasingly narrow in the future for goods and services must be extended to the transformation. "In the future everyone comes to Foca , you know that is a personalized service to individuals of payment products , rather than a mere being , the gift of prepaid cards ." Cheng Chun said . <p>
						<p class="step"> Dialogue <p>
						<p class="step"> From " big barrier " to seize the individual market <p>
						<p> Group Chairman Cheng Chun Yu Fu expressed the hope that transition to provide individuals with personalized value-added services, payment agencies <p>
						<p> Beijing News : Why should launch of " fiscal Card" ? <p>
						<p> Cheng Chun : Choi Yu Fu fought card is an important step in the individual market . From the end of last year , Yu Fu has begun to individual markets Pathfinder , 24K Gold, Redstar and other individuals for personalized products have a good market response . Currently this part of the personal card sales proportion has reached 25% -30%. Our goal is three years, personal card market sales accounted for more than 90% . <p>
						<p> Beijing News: the high cost of the individual market , but also more complicated, why should fought " small profits" of the individual market ? <p>
						<p> Cheng Chun : have to turn, this is the future direction. <p>
						<p> current prepaid card business model is unitary and profitable way . We base than is how big , powerful conglomerates scramble or government agencies , but due to the homogenization of products , customers constitute a unity . <p>
						<p> In addition, corporate customers influenced by external factors , which may cause some small-scale enterprises have a greater operating risks. This instability is not conducive to long-term development prepaid card industry . <p>
						<p> However, with business groups , government agencies and other powerful "big " compared to individual consumers more rational choice : In the multi-card era, if not looking for a reason to choose a prepaid cards , which must be more good service , better prices . Future 2023 , prepaid industry will enter melee phase, enclosure, price wars , mergers and acquisitions can occur at any such sale . <p>
						<p> Beijing News: how the individual market earnings expectations ? <p>
						<p> Cheng Chun : single project , I do a short-term unprofitable preparation, and this is our transition costs. Yufu want to change people's understanding of existing prepaid card , after we talk to Yu Fu , comes to mind is to provide individuals with personalized value-added services, payment institutions , rather than a mere being , gift company. <p>
						<p> In fact, in the United States , prepaid development goes beyond the purely commercial payments and shopping vouchers and move towards all aspects of social life . Compared to foreign markets, China 's personal card market has great potential, but yet to be excavated . <p>
						<p> Beijing News : Recently, the company changed its name to complete the network changed its name to Yu Yu Fu Fu payment , but also step into the individual market do ? <p>
						<p> Cheng Chun : Yu Fu network giving the impression that the name range and wide, but the positioning is not too clear , but the concept of the company's relatively limited network online . The pay was renamed Yufu want to express is that Yufu is focused on doing payment company, and is online and offline together and force . <p>
						<p> Beijing News: The cooperation with CITIC Bank whether Yufu a springboard into the traditional finance ? <p>
						<p> Cheng Chun : Yu Fu Group and CITIC Bank The partnership is a third-party payment industry with the traditional financial sector cooperation a good start. <p>
						<p> precisely, Yu Fu Group and CITIC Bank to enter this partnership is not the traditional financial sector, but to serve in traditional sectors . <p>

						<p> Central bank in July new regulations to support third-party payment agencies line bypassing UnionPay POS acquiring business , but in China UnionPay has a monopoly does not. <p>
						<p> Alipay announced due to " some well-known reasons " to stop the line POS acquiring business . The background of this statement is that China UnionPay Board has recently filed a motion to urge the member banks want to unified action , and gradually the non- payment institutions CUP CUP card transactions fully migrated to the network , and for the first time explicitly put forward to achieve this goal time node . <p>
						<p> Rise of online payment , third-party payment in the context of rapid expansion , UnionPay, banks and third-party payment melee pattern has been going on for years . Judgment in the industry, regulators tend to open at the same time , China UnionPay contrarian "rights" , so that the inter-agency long-term accumulation of contradictions surfaced. <p>
						<p class="step"> Central New Deal Two Interpretations <p>
						<p> 7 months, the People's Bank of China last year for public comment " acquiring business management approach" when baked , the industry may not have thought would lead to two diametrically opposite interpretation. <p>
						<p> Line acquiring business (POS) ranking the country at the forefront of Communications to pay the judgment , the management There are three major changes : First, clear the online and traditional offline acquirers received and incorporated into a single regulation , establish All the central bank as the acquiring institution regulatory authorities ; Second acquirer transaction information can be sent directly to the issuing bank ; Third cancel the industry known as " a line of a cabinet a machine" mandatory. <p>
						<p> Of the " direct" mode to define the "Measures " on page 26 : Acquirer transaction information will be sent directly to the issuing bank , the issuing bank shall comply with the relevant bank card clearing agency under the agreement , with the signing of cooperation agreement, explicit transaction information and financial security, cardholders and merchants rights protection and other rights , obligations and breach of contract. <p>
						<p> " Payment institutions and banks direct connection mode for the first time appeared in the regulators and regulations , we believe that means that the central bank acquiesced in this pattern exists." a third party payment companies who Tencent Finance said . <p>
						<p> But China UnionPay launched a recent board meeting in the history of the most stringent performance requirements - " December 31, 2013 , complete non- payment institutions ( mainly" third party payment " ) line of business migration CUP card transactions unified sent CUP transfer " ; " July 1, 2014 , to achieve non- payment agencies full access to the Internet CUP CUP card transactions . " <p>
						<p> Sources such third party payment companies , which has been implemented motion , there are banks and third-party payment unauthorized direct cooperation , suffered a UnionPay severe penalties, third-party payment , and definitely not the amount banks can afford, since to the role of warning to others . <p>
						<p> China UnionPay 's explanation is that the acquirer and issuer of the " direct" , provided that the issuing bank to comply with the relevant bank card clearing agency agreement . As a bank card association , China UnionPay is the " UnionPay " brand owners , commercial banks, non- payment institutions and other industries to carry out the parties UnionPay card business , the use of the " UnionPay " brand, should be recognized by all parties concerned to comply with CUP card business rules, technical standards and market discipline . At present, more than 60 major non- payment agencies are involved in the CUP network . <p>
						<p> Union also said that as a bank card organization , China UnionPay has always supported the non- payment of innovation and development. Union and non- payment mechanism in the payment industry in different environments , both sides accepting the network construction, standard setting, risk prevention , technological innovation and other aspects of interaction and co-operation. Non- payment agencies are involved in the CUP network , the commercial banks can effectively achieve a comprehensive CUP card acceptance . At present, more than 60 major non- payment institutions access UnionPay network . <p>
						<p> However caused banks , third-party payment companies objectionable because they have no choice , " the third-party payment companies sources, this motion has been implemented, there are banks and third-party payment unauthorized direct cooperation , suffered a UnionPay heavy penalties , the amount of third-party payment , and by no means banks can withstand , played a role in warning to others . - "This motion. <p>
						<p class="step"> CUP sense of crisis <p>
						<p> As the only domestic bank card organization , the only inter-bank transaction clearing system construction and operators in the pay of big changes in the industry environment , China UnionPay pins and needles, is the second large-scale "rights" origin. <p>
						<p> In March 2013 held in two sessions, two members of the CPPCC National Committee submitted a joint " on the promotion of bank card settlement market opening up ," the proposal to prove safety China UnionPay monopoly recommend liquidation of the bank card market for domestic private capital open , or build " the NLD ." <p>
						<p> Author of this proposal were China Securities Regulatory Commission Vice Lord Ren Wangxian market regulation and industrial party Central Committee Chen Jianguo . " I have to make repeated calls to solve the problem CUP monopoly ." Chen Jianguo said . <p>
						<p> Informed sources, the internal judge UnionPay bank card as the only domestic brand , the issuing organization of the situation may change , the future does not rule out a " Communications Card" , "Alipay card" possibilities, and therefore only intensify maintenance of existing CUP the brand equity . <p>
						<p> Central bank announced on July 4 , repealed " People's Bank of China on the harmonization enable the" UnionPay " logo and hologram mark notice", " People's Bank of China on the issuance of < 2001 bank card network joint work to implement the views > of notice . " These two documents required domestic commercial banks have settled in RMB bank card function is enabled on the need to unify " UnionPay " logo , once security UnionPay card as the only organization status . <p>
						<p> Foreign bank card organizations into China seems to have just a matter of time. July 2012 , WTO panel report found " the renminbi -denominated payment card transaction settlement , the Union has a monopoly " and that China should be at the end of July this year, the introduction of appropriate policies , China's third-party payment market or will usher in the first batch foreign brands . <p>
						<p> Currently expected to be not in accordance with the timetable for progress , but the " Economic Information Daily ( microblogging ) ," recently reported that the central bank is studying the development of offshore bank card payment services organizations to enter Chinese market regulatory policies. VISA, MASTERCARD and other officially entered the RMB market can be expected. <p>
						<p> Another reality can not be ignored is that China UnionPay focused traditional offline POS machine business, the status of the entire payment ecosystem is declining . <p>
						<p> China UnionPay 's revenue structure of the main three : Domestic POS transaction transfer income , ie credit card merchant's commission portion ; domestic ATM income ; international business income and innovative business income . POS transaction switching revenue accounted for about UnionPay revenues 60% -70% . <p>
						<p> Institute of Finance, the State Council Development Research Center, deputy director of Ba ( microblogging ) expects online payment transactions as a whole accounted for the proportion of total retail sales of social consumer goods will increase every year , online payments over the next 3-5 years is expected to exceed the line pay . <p>
						<p> According to iResearch statistics, in 2012 China Internet payment business transactions reached 3.6589 trillion , an increase of 66% over the past seven years, the average annual growth rate of 111% . <p>
						<p class="step"> Payments industry changing situation <p>
						<p> Though Alipay contradiction with the Consortium has publicly intensified, but the short term lead to more third-party payment has not been follow-up adjustments. <p>
						<p> YeePay said that the current line of the POS business developed well in the future will not stop , will pay more attention to the combination of online and offline business model innovation , " we judge the future direction of development is acquiring market is relatively more open , but the specific reference to the regulatory authorities should be interpreted . "<p>
						<p> Addition a third party payment companies ChinaPnR said that the current online and offline business has not been affected , is still running. Remitted line acquiring business through agents to traditional small businesses to promote, remittance insiders said , whether you choose directly connected with the bank , or to continue cooperation with the Consortium , which mainly depends on two parties cooperate at a lower cost , and no selection tendencies. EPRO pay responded that the current line of the POS business developed well in the future will not stop , will pay more attention to the combination of online and offline business model innovation , " we judge the future direction of development is acquiring market is relatively more open, but specific reference to the regulatory authorities should explain . "<p>
						<p> Industry insider said , stopping POS machine business is mainly based on two considerations . First online paid under field UnionPay payment referees and athletes who are also business , this monopoly position in the industry has deep roots . If the Union 's position does not change, will continue to have bargaining power , then the line to pay business will be difficult financial innovation. <p>
						<p> Secondly, in the central bank to disclose third-party payment can be directly connected with the signal after the release of the New Deal , the motion clearly contrary to the Union Bank of New Deal . Third party payment companies in the middle of the central bank with the Consortium did not know who to listen to , and direction for the industry outlook is not very clear. "In this case the relative confusion , preferring to choose to terminate the business ," he said. <p>
						<p> Industry insider believes that this part of the costs will be allocated to the end user who, say, will be further transferred to the commodity prices. "If the Union 's position does not change, will continue to have bargaining power , then the line of business will be difficult to pay financial innovation ." <p>
						<p> Haitong Securities recently released research report shows that in 2012 the size of offline payment ( line acquirer ) has more than 20 trillion , of which bank card credit card spending about 9.1 trillion , accounting for 43% of total retail sales of social ; 2012 line size of about 8.9 trillion third-party payment , accounting line received 42% of a single market , but 90% of them from the Union . <p>
						<p> From merchant POS machines share, in addition to the CUP , the largest proportion of third-party payment agencies fir Deutsche Bank Cartoon ( state-controlled ) accounted for only 4.9 per cent share of the business , accounting for 0.2% pay Communications . According to Tencent Finance understood , fir Germany , Communications cooperation with the Consortium have been paid . <p>
						<p> Looks line market has no suspense. However, third-party online payment market size of up to 3.7 trillion in transactions involving bank cards can be part of China UnionPay smoothly incorporated , yet to be tested . <p>
						<p> " Acquiring business management approach" mainly on the bank card acquiring business rules , risk, management has made a definition . Bank card acquiring business is through the bank card acceptance terminals merchant bank Carter about collecting monetary funds settlement services , divided into two kinds of online and offline . Line acquiring mainly through POS credit card to complete ; online acquiring the network acquirers , merchants can be completed via the Internet payment and settlement . <p>
						<p> The stop Alipay POS acquiring business , briefly , is to collect credit card payments through the POS . Many third-party payment started on the Internet , but with the e-commerce consumer demand , there are many companies to expand the line acquiring business .

						<p> Wait less than a month's time, this industry may also full of " mobile payment" this popular vocabulary. Because , micro-channel payment possible at this month or early next month to open the line to pay the merchant's checkout micro-channel mode. By that time , micro-channel or will really be in people's lives , " purse ." <p>
						<p> Although the introduction of the time points and business cooperation have not yet determined, but has become a trend line micro-channel pay one of the primary problem . <p>
						<p> Micro-channel pay in full layout begins when the PayPal payment products including foreign and domestic Alipay accelerated optimization products are also in the form , so that the respective product line closer to the user 's consumption patterns . <p>
						<p> Last week , PayPal update the application after adding an important feature that allows users to find nearby restaurants. By ordering and some mobile companies, the user can select in advance in the application of a la carte restaurant nearby . Orders directly after closing the application , eliminating the need to deliver cash or another credit card and the waiter in the process . <p>
						<p> According to earlier news , Paypal are also being planned in the new version of the mobile client to add something like " public account " concept. When , cooperative businesses will have a separate page , the integration of user-oriented service businesses . While Alipay declined to comment on this news , but yesterday , Ali adjustment to the framework architecture has to convey a clear signal that they will enhance the mobile terminal business. <p>
						<p> Summarize these products recently paid all the moves , it is easy to conclude that : payment products really want to start doing serious business line up . <p>
						<p> In fact, the industry shouting " mobile payment " trend had begun two years ago , but look around those people living in the first-tier cities , the real line phone out to pay for consumption scenario is still rare. This area is difficult due to rapid changes in consumer habits , of course, and the industry did not find the real tipping point related . <p>
						<p> May at this tepid period , micro-channel pay ignite domestic payments for the birth of a new product or a business innovation will play a key role in a number . With micro-channel large active user base and micro-channel pay levels in the product 's ease of use advantages of experience in education to re- recognize the mobile end user to pay respect, it will become one of the core strengths of the product . <p>
						<p> tAccording to the micro-channel pay eam introduced its line of business promotion is still preliminary user nurture based. This is shown in the first wave of cooperation mainly around buy merchant. For example initially with micro buy ( Micro Signal weituangou) existing business cooperation , in Little Sheep , gold hat and more than 20 food and beverage store for sweeping yards payment product experience. User by using a micro-channel two-dimensional code scanning line , enter the micro-channel payment page after paying only a penny , will be able to get a bottle of Wong Lo Kat or mineral water. Next, the co- buy platform will gradually increase , such as Gao Peng beauty regiment will start to access in. <p>
						<p> Micro-channel pay the team hope that through these step by step user attempts to instill awareness for offline payment and usage . In the initial user nurture implementation, will begin with a large restaurant chains together to achieve the checkout you can use to complete the two-dimensional code scanning micro-channel payment . <p>
						<p> Micro-channel users are insiders know better Commenting on the development of products in the field of payment will point out the advantages . But in this area, Alipay strength is still not be underestimated. <p>
						<p> " Micro-channel pay currently occupy the leading edge of the mobile terminal user base thanks to its micro-channel by providing technical support TenPay trend line , which is not owned by Paypal , but Paypal for the status quo had been a marked awareness, Close Taobao merchants such as micro-channel sales channel the future will see them take more measures . " Insiders disclosed . <p>
						<p> Alipay level of resources in the business and a bargaining chip is the product advantages. From the product point of view form , micro-channel pay for ease of use does not have barriers, if Alipay really started to mobilize resources, or to create a strong pay channels, which pay the same for the micro-channel is a great challenge . <p>
						<p> Can be expected that both sides online paid under this struggle , the respective advantages and disadvantages will be the manner in which they are to be considered under the premise line . Which relates to the user and a business line education payment security , network environment , or both attractive platform matching . <p>
						<p> This battle will lead to a long-awaited industry mobile payment tipping point ' ? The answer may be unveiled this year . <p>

						<p class="secondStep"> 1. Offline payment : + platform to promote market segments <p>
						<p> " Offline payment " : + platform operating segments . "Offline payment" 90% share of the Union and the banks were split , other " third party " business model : market segment specialization and customization services ; " platform management" to improve efficiency . Other "third party" Future space is relatively limited <p>
						<p> Inherent market structure: a long time, banks are subject to pay , the bank has a customer , credit and financial products and networks , and many other advantages, but as a third-party payment agencies can not provide additional value in the case of hard to grab market share with banks . <p>
						<p> Traditional single source of income , the marginal cost is higher : inability to issue bank cards, prepaid cards should be very limited due control , so third-party payment of income sources and are basically divided into acquiring institution charges . Offline payment , the fee structure is divided into : acquirer 20% , 10% of transfer institutions , card issuers 70%. However, due to intense competition, acquiring institutions to compete for merchant acquiring competing cost pressures , and further compression acquiring profits , making third-party payment unprofitable. In contrast , the bank's revenue diversification : ① acquirer 20% and as issuers of 70%; ② merchant deposits derived can be used for lending to obtain interest margins . ③ customer's account settlement , transfer and other intermediary business revenue . And because the bank payment and settlement network has proven to lower the marginal cost of customer development . <p>
						<p> Therefore , third-party online payment institutions under the field to be another way , there are two main aspects : <p>
						<p> Development market segments, take the professional road : either Union or commercial banks , subject to the business focus and management ability , online payment area is mainly provided under the homogenization of basic services, can not be based industries and enterprises to provide professional characteristics and customized products , there is no further digging deeper customer demand . This gives third-party payment provides survival and development of space. <p>
						<p> Table 1: line of specialized third-party payment features <p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/77.png"/>
						<p> Platform-based development and management , enhance the potential value : Although online banking under the CUP and very powerful, but there are also business corner. For example, at the risk and cost considerations, UnionPay and merchant acquiring banks have higher requirements, such as four cards to a photo, turnover, operating area, and other places , which put many small micro- businesses shut . <p>
						<p> Meanwhile, third-party companies through the " Internet " and " platform" model, business copy , low cost, improve management and operational efficiency in the market segments beyond the Union and other powerful competitors. The third-party payment can make use external teams , and actively expand the formation of platforms economy, profits derived from other modes such as advertising, sales finance , micro- loans. <p>
						<p> With the popularity of bank card transactions , offline payment applications growth is gradually slowing down , while the third-party payment mechanism is difficult to break the bank at the core of the CUP and transaction structure . While some institutions through market segments, customer structure and value added services to enhance sinking market share, but it is difficult to break the traditional financial institutions currently dominant pattern. <p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2. Online payment : virtual account + electronic business platform <p>
						<p> " Online payment " business model . Business model: the development of electronic business platform through payment platform alternative to bank accounts through a virtual account , the Internet business . Competition is entering the Red Sea areas: Paypal, money paid through and CUP three accounted for 80%, and centralization trend intensified. Platform economy is often a " winner takes all , Hengqiang " situation. <p>
						<p> Electronic business platform is the basis for the development of third-party payment online : online payment online shopping is the largest application , accounting for 42% of the total size . The emergence of electronic business platform and development will not only break the traditional pattern of trade , but also completely break the old pattern of payments and transactions . <p>
						<p> Bank online payments under the accumulated advantages can not be reflected online . Line banking and payment system is a closed system based UnionPay and businesses in terms of cost , convenience and safety considerations is difficult to accept third-party payment as acquirers . But online payment is an open system , reflected in : ① Internet-based technologies can be efficiently implemented payment acquirers and card issuers to-many , without the need CUP transfer, so that the system openness greatly enhanced. ② online paid under , the merchant finds it hard to accept multiple acquirers , partly because the regulatory restrictions, the other is the cost of acquiring institution 's terminal . However, online payment , the acquirer is a terminal payment gateway , the cost is almost zero, so businesses can choose to use multiple acquirers , third-party payment which reduces barriers to entry . <p>
						<p> Figure 1: Online payment application direction <p>
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/78.png"/>
						<p> Virtual online payment accounts to solve the biggest obstacle . Online payment and offline payment biggest difference is that spatial asymmetry. Line to pay money, goods can be done face to face two clear , but the distance online payment due to space , it is difficult to achieve crunching in the traditional pay system must have one to take on additional risk. The virtual account ( Paypal, money paid through ) the emergence of solving this problem through a virtual account , paid by a third party credit intermediary bear the responsibility , which led to completion of the transaction . <p>
						<p> Virtual accounts and bank accounts of the relationship . Virtual Internet Payment Account is a core ( to solve network problems consumer credit intermediaries ) , but also the third-party payment mechanism is one main profit model . The specific mode of operation is as follows : <p>
						<p> Virtual Account established third-party payment ( eg Paypal , etc. ) , you must set up a total in the bank reserve account . Unified virtual account funds handled in this reserve account . <p>
						<p> Consumer customers use virtual account transfer process, will precipitate out in the reserve account within a certain amount of money. This part of interest income on funds owned by third-party payment agencies all . However, third-party payment organizations are not able to reserve account free to dispose of funds , only survival or time deposits up to one year , so most of these funds can only get current interest income. <p>
						<p> Alipay precipitation funds in the reserve account are two types: one is to be liquidated funds ( such as the use of water, electricity payments , but also credit card and bank card transfer ) , on behalf of the Alipay payment cycle is generally through a bank in a day or more, so these funds will be designated to go before settling in the reserve account ; second is the intermediate account funds ( such as Taobao shopping ) , because Alipay credit intermediary is a great feature , so customers use PayPal to shop online , the funds are first transferred to the intermediate Alipay account , and then when the customer receives the goods to confirm payment active or passive ( passive Alipay payment was 20 days ) . Reserve account interest income mainly from the second category , the first category of funds is mainly precipitated period is too short , so the contribution of low income . <p>
						<p> Domestic third-party payment platform, the top three are: Paypal, money paid through and CUP , accounting for more than 90% market share . TenPay Alipay and provisioning of consistent management model , but CUP different. Since the People's Bank of China UnionPay subordinate state-owned enterprises so UnionPay reserve account in the People's Bank rather than commercial banks , and its reserve account funds are not interest income . UnionPay profit model mainly rely on transaction fees . <p>
						<p> Currently online payment into the three pillars situation. Paypal, money paid through all my colleagues have electronic business platform and virtual accounts with two magic weapons . The CUP online is largely dependent on its special background in areas such as public utilities and monopolies have a larger market share. So , on the whole Paypal, money paid through and UnionPay market share of over 80%. The networking platform-dependent economies tend to have a winner- take-all, Hengqiang results, unless the application of revolutionary technologies or the birth of a leader and pursuer gap may be widening . As the Internet penetration and pay increase, the industry growth rate will slow down . <p>

					<h1 class="H1">Wells Fargo History</h1>
					<div class="zz">Author：admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published：2013-11-19 13:26:00</div>
					<div class="xx">
						<p> 2013-07-24, Wells Fargo market value beyond China Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the " cosmic OK " From sit tight in the past six years of the " global market first bank" pulled down on the throne . In the "market first" behind this change of vanity , reflecting the overall strength of the market for Wells Fargo fully affirmed . </p>
						<p> In the final part , we will provide you fupan Wells Fargo various stages of growth , transformation and upgrading of Wells Fargo the road and explore : Wells Fargo's core competencies what ? Wells Fargo Bank to domestic banks should learn what ? </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo's development process can be divided into the following four stages : </p>
						<p> First stage, in 1852 the last century 80 's: born out of the courier company's community banks . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo's predecessor was established in 1852, Wells Fargo companies, mainly in the western United States to provide banking and courier services. In 1905, Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Company formally separated from . 1960, Wells Fargo outlets gradually extends from the northern California to the south , to the 1980s, has become one of California's largest community banks . </p>
						<p> Aecond stage, the 1980s to 1994 : inter-state regional bank operations . </p>
						<p> 1982 , the U.S. banking mergers across state policy began to loosen. To adapt to changes in regulatory policy , to expand their business income source , Wells Fargo began in California and neighboring states mergers and acquisitions business . Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Wells Fargo acquired more than 100 financial institutions . </p>
						<p> Third phase , from 1995 to 2008 : a national bank . </p>
						<p> Since the 1990s , the United States to further relax the banking business across state regulatory policies . To seize the policy opportunities , improve market position in the United States , Wells Fargo have acquired First Interstate Bank , Northwest Bank , Wachovia Bank and other medium and large banks , the business scope expanded to the United States . </p>
						<p> Fourth stage, since 2009 : to enhance the integration of national banks . </p>
						<p> 2009 onwards, beginning with Wachovia Wells Fargo integration, including the integration of business systems, merging overlapping outlets, staff and other outlets to reschedule merge . The end of 2011 , the number of institutions of Wells Fargo Bank 9112 , compared with the initial acquisition of Wachovia decreased by nearly 2000 , net profit but also to achieve a continuous climb. </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo Bank in the five strategic transformation and upgrading </p>
						<p> At Wells Fargo transformation and upgrading process, there are five strategies that have never shaken. For the implementation of these five strategies , but also to Wells Fargo in the development and growth at the same time , and gradually formed its own core competitiveness. </p>
						<p> Specifically , these five strategies are : </p>
						<p> One , unswervingly adhere to the core business . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo 's core business is the following three lines : </p>
						<p> Community banks , mainly for individuals and small businesses ( with annual sales of less than $ 20 million ) to provide , including investment and financing , insurance, trust and other comprehensive financial services ; </p>
						<p> Wholesale banking , with annual sales of over 20 million U.S. dollars for the medium-sized enterprises, including investment and financing, investment banking, international business, real estate, insurance , consulting and other financial services ; </p>
						<p> Wealth management, including financial management, brokerage and pension services for customers including wealth management, personal finance overall program and other services. </p>
						<p> These three lines of the central position is not easy, in the 1980s , in response to market-oriented reforms , Wells Fargo walked a large U.S. commercial banks and other different development routes: the face of JP Morgan Chase, Citibank , etc. big banks , have the investment banking business as a development priority , to expand investment and brokerage business , Wells Fargo has chosen to stick - stick to traditional commercial banking business positions, adhere to the community banking business for the main business . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo's business lines adjusted several times , and gradually formed a community bank , wholesale bank-based , supplemented by three rich banking business structure . Among them, the community banks are Wells Fargo 's main source of income. Its mainly for individuals and small businesses to provide comprehensive and diversified financial services. Since 2000, the community bank 's income share has remained at 50 percent or more, some years up to 70% . </p>
						<p> Two , roots in the local market , focusing on economies of scale </p>
						<p> With the process of development and growth of most banks , like Wells Fargo in their own development process has also repeatedly acquire other banks, but many competitors overseas mergers and acquisitions, to expand in overseas markets are different, Wells Fargo's merger with local technology -based, do not blindly international mergers and acquisitions. As of the end of 2011 , 97% of Wells Fargo 's banking assets and 98 % of employees are in the United States , only eight foreign branches , foreign loans account for only 5% of assets, Wells Fargo and Citibank 54% of its assets in local , foreign branches reached 347 in stark contrast. </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo is not without international ambition , has been targeting the rich countries are themselves in a " major global financial institutions ." But in reality the operation process, the initiative is still rich with Citigroup, HSBC and other large financial institutions, multinational business development strategy in stark contrast to its main M & A activity in the United States were complete. </p>
						<p> To better fit its own development strategy , Wells Fargo proposed merger six principles: 1, cultural compatibility ; 2, the project operability ; 3 , helps to improve customer relations ; 4 , fully understand the risks ; 5, the internal rate of return of 15% ; 6 , within three years of acquisition value. As long as it can meet the six principles , Wells Fargo's acquisition initiatives are often bold and decisive, staged a number of " Tunxiang " M & A play, gradually expanded their service area to the entire United States , and to establish ahead of network scale. </p>
						<p> Three , dot positioning accuracy, ability to sell amazing </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo will own retail outlets called the " Store " (Store), and in-store design using a number of retail and supermarket concept , in order to emphasize the importance of customers and services . Some stores also draws on Wal-Mart's financial practices , sent to greet the customer, to introduce new products, by product correlation display promotional materials and so on. </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo's business objective is "to meet customer demand in all financial aspects , to help them in the development of financial success," trying to make itself into a customer needs to provide any product "department store supermarket" style universal financial institution . To this end, Wells Fargo customer-centric design more than 80 business units , covering the entire life cycle of the customer 's principal financial needs that may arise , as Wells Fargo implementation of the " one-stop" financial supermarket services, solid foundation. </p>
						<p> At the same time , Wells Fargo is the nation's ability to sell the strongest banks. Wells Fargo a few decades, fostered a strong cross-selling capabilities , and received a " cross-selling of the King" in the world. Wells Fargo is not only vigorously promote cross-selling in the internal corporate culture , and through a series of mechanisms to ensure that the concept of cross-selling to the ground. Wells Fargo Bank to establish an efficient customer relationship management platform , a client manager for each customer to provide integrated information and knowledge of financial products , and on this basis to establish a model for customer identification and response prediction models to effectively identify potential customer needs and improve marketing efficiency . </p>
						<p> Four , unique risk control mechanism , focusing on small and micro business capacity building </p>
						<p> In the same industry , Wells Fargo earlier discovered the potential of small and micro- businesses , and launched a dedicated service brand. In the early 1990s , Wells Fargo successfully established a small micro- enterprise credit scoring system , a small micro- enterprise loans and technical support essential to the success . In addition, the Wells Fargo Bank to small micro- enterprise loans personal loans taken by regulatory approach to scientific and quantitative risk management model to ensure that risk control. </p>
						<p> With a unique business model and risk management philosophy, Wells Fargo, the rapid development of small and micro- enterprise business . As of 2011 </p>
						<p> End of the year , small micro-enterprise loans grew 8% , higher than the overall loan growth by 7 percentage points ; "Enterprise Link" handled more than 2 million loan , of which 2 /3 of the lending decisions is done automatically by the system . First three quarters of 2012 , Wells Fargo new loans to small businesses $ 11.4 billion , compared with an increase of approximately 30% over the same period last year . </p>
						<p> By successful small and micro business practices , Wells Fargo not only won wide acclaim from society , but also to get beyond the interbank spreads around 1% level . This is in the highly competitive U.S. financial markets , is a very remarkable achievement . </p>
						<p> Five , emphasis on the development and integration of electronic channels , providing the best customer experience </p>
						<p> As of the end of 2011 , Wells Fargo 's electronic banking and mobile banking customers were more than 22.4 million and 7.3 million , more than 50% of the customer 's business is done through electronic channels . This means that Wells Fargo has not only become the most developed physical outlets nationwide bank , also has the nation's most advanced electronic banking system . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo electronic service channels, including online banking , customer service centers and portal. Three systems link different ways for customers to build a unified , comprehensive marketing and business function service calls platforms: online banking online services support functions , mainly located in the customer account and asset management applications ; Customer Center supports automatic speech interaction , telephone , E-mail and letters and other multi -channel access , customer self-service or bank agent will complete the customer across time and geographical sales and service requests ; portal is Wells Fargo marketing channels and services on the Internet focused on the application of . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo individual needs of all channels are made of highly integrated with the product , can be used in the stores channel touch PinPad to replace the traditional electronic data display, greatly enhance the customer experience ; ATM content analysis of customer data may be based on the background options to customize to customer needs ; Similarly, mobile phones and network channels are also customizable. Convenient , personalized electronic channels , greatly enhance the Wells Fargo customer satisfaction. </p>
						<p> In addition , Wells Fargo can also take advantage of various sites , segment customer groups , enhance customer service experience. Wells Fargo happy in a variety of popular sites , applications interact with customers , such as Facebook, Myspace, Youtube, Twitter , etc. , to become part of the lifestyle customers . In addition , in order to more interaction with customers , Wells Fargo also introduced professional guidance for all types of customers blog , such as the 2006 launch of the Guided by History blog , September 2006 launch of the student loan blog , launched in 2010, specifically for fund clients Advantage blog . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo 's core competency is what ? </p>
						<p> From Wells Fargo 's case, we can be refined out, Wells Fargo's core competitiveness, what is it ? </p>
						<p> I think there are basically three things : </p>
						<p> 1, well-run channels , focusing traditional business </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo experience tells us that effective services through the traditional model of the real economy is still profitable commercial banks of the Li line . And good service to the real economy , deep banks of several major traditional business , must be based on existing customers , enhance the multi-channel interaction between services and channels , improve channel capacity and improve the profitability of existing customers contribution . This is Wells Fargo from small to large , with " weak" wins strong, the financial crisis has made leaps and bounds of the fundamental. </p>
						<p> 2, a clear business innovation , rigorous business process concept </p>
						<p> Main traditional businesses do not mean to do according to the traditional idea that the implementation of the innovation must not hesitate , the elimination of thinking must be decisively eliminated. Wells Fargo's success, not only because it has the nation's largest network system , and not only because of Wells Fargo less involved in derivatives trading , which suffer the same time in the same industry to " survive " down . Wells Fargo itself has a very strong sense of business innovation , which helped it in community banks , small and micro enterprises and other businesses the upper hand , as a latecomer to imitate , learn specimens. But Wells Fargo's innovation is to follow the concept of a rigorous business processes , which means the field of innovation are subject to certain constraints , the boundaries of innovation have also been set more stringent in order to avoid temptation and a trap in the land strayed into the minefield of financial markets . </p>
						<p> 3, powerful marketing capabilities and cost control capabilities </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo will always adhere to the customer's interests first , the target is to try to meet all the needs of our customers . This is throughout the product design, sales and service , becoming Wells Fargo 's core philosophy and development momentum. As can be targeted R & D -related products, which directly boost the Wells Fargo products, services, marketing capabilities on a powerful performance . 2011 , Wells Fargo 's retail products for each family to achieve an average number of 5.92 , the highest area reached 7.38 . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo's ability to control the cost of a first class in the same industry . On the one hand , Wells Fargo deposit costs in the industry has maintained a relatively low level , on the other hand , Wells Fargo in the network cost control , operational cost control is also erudite ( a Wells Fargo Bank's " shop" construction costs compared to traditional outlets the fourth ) . 2012 , through the whole line up and down the structure of the department re-integration and cut unnecessary expenses , Wells Fargo cost to income ratio from 61% in 2011 down to 57.1% . </p>
						<p> Summarized above three points from first glance there is nothing special , channel management, business innovation , process control, cost control ...... are commonplace topic of domestic banks . But in fact, these things can really be deemed " core competencies" to run , how many do ? </p>
						<p> Formation of core competitiveness , the need for refinement of existing businesses and focus is also inseparable from the external reference and learning experience . Bank's core competitiveness is not formed spontaneously , but in a certain stage cycle, through conscious innovation, beyond and learning in their own experience of failure and mistakes which constantly reflect and summed up. So, I hope the above cases for Wells Fargo recovery disk , for China's banking practitioners, not just worth reading the story in the same industry , it should be triggered deep thinking primers , the only way to truly understand the bank's core competitiveness key , and can walk in reshaping the core competitiveness of the right path . </p>

					<h1 class="H1">Seven Steps of financial crisis</h1>
					<div class="zz">Author：admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published：2013-11-19 13:26:00</div>
					<div class="xx">
						<p> Interbank interest rates rose is the first step in the financial crisis , which is " Luther economics " and " Solitaire Tower " in the content . </p>
						<p> Commercial banks play two jar lids are ten games . Absorb 200 million deposit , put 800 million loans. Thus, a total of 1 billion deposit , lending a total of 800 million . 800 000 000 Loan repayment schedule if successful , the deposit will return 200 million . If the loan is not being paid to put out , then it will become bad loans , total deposits will not disappear. Then , if someone withdrawal amount over 200 million , the bank will fail. </p>
						<p> Theoretically, depositors withdraw money from a bank , sooner or later, but also into the banking system , such as B bank . So, when a bank is unable to cope with it , A Bank B Bank can help. The banks borrow money from each other 's behavior , is lending . The shortest possible only by an evening that overnight . Banks have to pay interest on borrowed money , interest rates reflect market conditions . In China , this rate is shibor rates. </p>
						<p> Question is, if B banks are now also encountered a similar situation, then A bank is difficult to borrow money , because the B bank will not be able to lend to a bank , and their need to borrow money. AB Bank racing each other to borrow money, interbank interest rates will rise, A and Bank B Bank funding gap , the greater will raise interest rates to attract capital . From the entire banking industry perspective , shibor skyrocketing interest rates , it means that the entire banking system is extremely tight internal funds . </p>
						<p> At this time, the enterprise, suddenly faced with a dilemma , one side is the order disappears , one side is bank call loans. In order to keep businesses, a large number of relatively minor assets such as real estate and stocks will be sold . While everyone else is trying to squeeze time to go , everyone squeeze out. At this time, any assets not sell , only prices plummeted . </p>
						<p> At this time, those who are not owners of the assets of debt pressure , in order to avoid depreciation of their assets , suffered losses , will start selling assets held now . Thus , further exacerbating tension in the capital market funds and asset price declines degree . </p>
						<p> Cash-strapped banks to a certain extent , some small banks will begin to stop paying , that is difficult to depositors withdraw cash . Depositors in the bank account or accounts checked out checks, hard cash . At this time , it is brewing run trend. Once run trend began , large depositors will withdraw cash from the bank , then the entire financial crisis out of control , the central bank is also large-scale lending to commercial banks was too late . Check out the whole society into a large-scale state . This is the second step of the financial crisis . </p>
						<p> Theoretically as long as no right to print money , that is, the Bank of England have also been run . ( There is a similar situation in the 1970s, the Fed is run on gold. ) Reality, most countries tend to printing money to save the big banks involved in the national economy . </p>
						<p> In the meantime , a lot of foreign capital will flee , leading to further tension domestic bank funds , exacerbating the crisis . On the other hand , capital flight bound by the currency exchange international monetary, nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is gold, the U.S. dollar since mid-twentieth century . At this time, if the capital item is open, allowing a certain amount of local currency freely convertible currency under that country 's central bank printing money , can not stop the flight of capital . ( The Fed can print dollar bills , but can not print gold , which is the reason the Fed is run . ) Thus , the currency in the international market compared to international currency devaluation inevitable . This is the third step of the financial crisis . </p>
						<p> Massive devaluation of the currency in the short term domestic debt burden will inevitably lead to surge in imports of raw materials prices soared , export commodity prices. Many companies signed a long-term contract sales money will find themselves unable to purchase raw materials, production was interrupted. Of course , there are also companies will profit . However, profitable business is clearly not his own share to loss of business profits , so inevitable violent economic downturn . To avoid this situation , most countries will hat and no cattle , with the country's reserves to buy the currency sell-off flight capital , trying to reassure the public . At this time, the currency exchange rate will Yindie , even relatively stable. Meanwhile , the central bank 's foreign exchange reserves will continue to decline . Equivalent in foreign capital from the central bank withdrawals. This is the fourth step of the financial crisis . </p>
						<p> Once the central bank's foreign exchange reserves declined to a certain extent , we should be difficult to maintain a relatively stable currency exchange rate. The central bank or to other countries for help, either to the IMF for help. At this time , these organizations will help put these information public. Thus , the central bank in exchange for massive foreign nationals caught in the ocean of people's war . Let help countries in trouble, we go out harsh lending conditions , which is IMF 's practice . This is the fifth step of the financial crisis . </p>
						<p> After a dramatic decline after the devaluation of domestic capital , foreign capital back from a bargain purchase options such capital . Complete transfer of property rights , which is the sixth step of the crisis . Similarly, those who hold cash use of the financial crisis, domestic large-scale mergers and capital -friendly, complete the expansion of the financial crisis is the most critical step. This is brutal zero-sum game , and many people night returned to liberation . </p>
						<p> Finally, large-scale changes to their ownership of the asset , its economy is in a recession , soaring unemployment , social unrest, undone . In order to obtain the foreign market, stimulate the economy, increase employment , some countries take the initiative to devalue the currency . Since the recovery of many export-oriented enterprises , many foreign borrowing purchase equipment and raw materials companies in trouble . Profitable business out of business , mergers troubled businesses , this is the last step of the financial crisis . </p>
						<p> Financial crisis is an economic crisis , why are all the banks money at the same time, the specific cause is not a tight Bowen can be said clearly. Simply put , the capitalist system , any expansion in the end , as long as society as a whole did not reach the level of consumption corresponds to the height of the subsequent expansion , is bound to face the crisis . Governments can use alternative private consumption Government consumption , but the government itself inevitably fall into a debt crisis. Currency blockage in a few hands , the debt saddled on other members of society who, when money and debt accumulation reaches a certain level , it is inevitable financial crisis . Some people want to sell their assets to repay debts while others use their currency cheap acquisition of assets . This is the annihilation of credit money , similar in chemical experiments and the acid-base behavior . As long as there is capital expansion , it is inevitable transfer of property rights , the financial crisis is an intense and concentrated ownership transfer behavior . This is the stock of money that will be mobilized, they are mobilized reason is to cheap bargain . </p>
						<p> Central bank can print the currency , but can not print currency can be used to save the banks at the expense of inflation , but can not keep the currency of denomination . As long as there is foreign capital , allowing the free movement of capital , it is inevitable there will be the devaluation of the phenomenon. </p>

Just met inspections branch president , listening governor said recently in Dalian to build 100 community banks to . Staff affinity is also good, only downside is the provision of financial services is not too rich to be improved . </p>
						<p> Optimistic about the stock market newcomers : Visually this dot area of ​​about 50,60 square meters, the annual rent should not exceed 100,000 , with three staff members per capita annual income does not exceed 100,000 , equipment depreciation 50,000 , totaling a annual expenditure 450,000 .

						<p> In creating green financial aspects , China Ping An and pioneering applications , is the introduction of environmental pollution liability insurance , is also the first in the country . 2012 Ping An Insurance of environmental pollution liability insurance underwriting 830 , compared with 2011 increased by 70%, the total amount insured is $ 1.9 billion.

					<h1 class="H1">Community Bank: important direction for the transformation of commercial banks</h1>
					<div class="zz">Author：admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published：2013-11-19 13:26:00</div>
					<div class="xx">
						<p> The rapid development of mobile Internet technology , even as banks face enormous challenges , but also for the retail banking business transformation provides a new opportunity. Mobile Internet era of banking channel change will highlight the actual situation, "virtual" networks that accelerate the banking, mobile banking and other construction pace , "solid" is required close to the consumer , to develop community banks , and to achieve a high degree of online and offline cooperative banks .

All banks to conduct its own investment in fixed assets and the daily operation and management and services in this way with the traditional bank bank building physical outlets or self- consistent manner . Each community bank's investment in fixed assets and the annual operating costs total about $ 200,000. In this way build a small community bank has the following problems : First, the choice of site and construction will cost a lot of manpower and material resources ; second , one-time fixed asset investment, improve the proportion of non- interest-earning assets ; Third, the operational needs a certain number of employees , training, management, daily operating costs higher in the early difficult to have a better interest returns. </p>
						<p> 2. Professional service firms outsourcing model . Outsourcing to the strength of the professional company building , banks using finance leases or operating leases. Specialized company responsible for siting community bank outlets , property negotiations , community bank construction, daily operations and maintenance services . With respect to the construction and operation management of the banks in the advantages are: first, to reduce the bank a one-time investment in fixed assets of the bank increased the proportion of interest-earning assets ; Second , community bank outlets daily operations and product sales are outsourced , reducing staff training, management and daily operational costs ; Third , marketing and customer discovery outsourced to a third party , the bank is responsible to concentrate on consumer credit, credit card application audit , as well as providing funds, insurance , financial consulting high value-added businesses. </p>
						<p> Way through the whole outsourcing has distribution fast and personnel burden less obvious advantage of lower operating costs . </p>

						<p> For hundreds of thousands of square meters in the banks of outlets , the 90 square meters of small bank outlets unimaginable levels . </p>
						<p> This is Wells Fargo recently promoted "a new store forms ." For this nation's largest bank network , even when compared with itself , this is a fairly thin outlets big leap - area just their traditional outlets 1/4. </p>
						<p> Foreign media comment , dot revolution will enter a new century , Chinese banks react to this seemingly few , but a subtle change has been quietly happening. According to " China Business" reporter understanding, smart banking devaluation of Guangdong Development Bank will increase this year in key cities nationwide distribution , a new generation of dot area may be more than 60 square meters ; several banks nationwide financial convenience stores are inside forward. Many banking-related businesses interviewed the person in charge said that this year will intensify efforts to put outlets , but the shape and function will vary , retail chains will be the future direction of development of bank branches . </p>
						<p> " Community , intelligence is definitely the future direction of branch transformation , but not necessarily suitable for all banks , but also depending on the bank's own resources and conditions, or the blind transformation , not only fail to improve network capacity , but also waste of resources . " Deloitte financial Industry Deputy Director strategy and operations support treasure was said that banks can not be putting the cart before the branch transformation . Although intelligence is perhaps the most banking transformation gimmick label , but not the substance of branch transformation . Deloitte in a recent report, this is defined as " branch transformation 3.0 " era , the biggest goal is to achieve outlets ' customer-centric . " </p>
						<p class="step"> Outlets slimming </p>
						<p> With the development of mobile Internet technology and the popularity of smart mobile devices , bank product design, service models and marketing channels are re- shaping. </p>
						<p> Global market research firm JD Power study found that the last two years with the electronic channels and the development of mobile banking , business people through networks for the type and frequency is decreasing , especially young customer base , including deposits, accounts, transfer and other basic business decline fastest , and thus concluded : those outlets should tend to provide higher-value services. </p>
						<p> This trend for Chinese banks also not be unfamiliar , as of the end of 2012 , the listed banks are basically electronic banking replacement rate above 60% , which topped the China Merchants Bank retail e-banking channels cabinet surface replacement rate has reached 90.66 percent . It is in this case, smaller outlets have become a trend. China Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Institute of Finance Cities Kim Yu has written that , along with a large number of daily business diverted to online banking , mobile banking and other electronic channels , outlets no longer blindly pursue to meet all the needs of our customers one-stop service center, the size of physical outlets can reduced accordingly , the network in the form of more diverse . </p>
						<p> " Master multi -channel bank , it should be on different channels have different business focus and client classification . banking outlets future is a retail chain ." retail business in a joint-stock bank official says , is a smaller outlets an inevitable trend, the focus will be adjusted to provide business </p>
						<p> Some banks have put its vision into a reality, from the chairman Dong Wenbiao proposed to create a " financial district " since the Minsheng Bank has been introduced in Dalian , Wuhan, Shenzhen and other cities launched a " financial convenience store" laying work . According to local media reports, the size of these stores close to the newsstand , only need to configure twenty-three staff and can provide 24 hours of the intelligence services. </p>
						<p> "800 ~ 1000 square meters of rent , plus escalating labor costs , the bank opened a heavy burden on the traditional outlets ." a joint-stock Bank Beijing Branch official said , is more important is that now the banks are strengthening the retail business , large business by branch or head office to accept all the retail outlets of the most important is for individuals and small and micro , and therefore on the size and scope of business will be some streamlining . </p>
						<p> Intelligence factors also changing outlets thin as possible. Wells Fargo ATM and network strategy director Jonathan Velline pointed out , adding new technology makes smaller outlets , you can override the original conditions are not suitable place to set up bank branches . </p>
						<p> In Guangdong Development Bank last year launched a smart banks, for example , the user can enter the small compartment identity , with a station VTM ( virtual teller system ) , you can do card buffet , and you can get a debit card on the spot , if problems encountered appropriate consultation , remote customer service will immediately start to offer help - in the Beijing Zoo underground mall inside GF smart banking area is just over 60 square meters . </p>
						<p> Currently banks are actively preparing for the intelligent transformation of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank VTM settled in China 's first mobile network of China Mobile Shanghai Pudong Development Bank to achieve self- branded card issuers ; Guangdong Development Bank electronic banking official said that this year will accelerate in the country layout 24 hours smart banking , including Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou and other cities in order to expand the focus ; Huaxia Bank is also clear that the 2013 annual report , and actively explore the construction of intelligent bank . </p>
						<p> Lack of network resources not only joint-stock banks , and even highlight the advantages of ICBC outlets are impossible to avoid this trend. Data show that as of the end of June 2013 , ICBC put into operation a total of 19,364 self-service banking , more than the total number of full- line outlets ; the customer self-service through ICBC bank for cash access business items as four times the counter outlets . </p>
						<p> ' Outlets is king ' bank ecology has changed, along with the development of mobile Internet technology and the popularity of smart mobile terminal equipment , the bank's product design, service models and marketing channels are re- shaping. We may not be able to fight the four lines and the number of outlets , but we can fight service , innovation and fight , fight and Technology . " Guangdong Development Bank Chairman Dong Jianyue representation . </p>
						<p class="step"> Smart enough? </p>
						<p> Despite emerging business channels alternative to traditional network channels becomes increasingly apparent , but the physical network to meet customer personalized, differentiated demand still plays an important role. </p>
						<p> So , the traditional outlets will be replaced by smart outlets do ? Banking Advisory abroad who pointed out that the future is like the Apple store banking outlets , as only responsible for selling an account , just like the Apple Store only need to buy an apple terminal , while all other users only need to download APP to complete. </p>
						<p> It seems premature , and even some exaggeration , even in the virtual bank 's international big firms use sophisticated equipment , and its physical outlets for the laying of enthusiasm unabated , because just as Jonathan Velline said, even if frequency was reduced to once or twice a year , but customers will still come network with business people regularly communicate , then the bank will be ready in place. </p>
						<p> " Customers will not switch to another intelligent terminal to a bank , or to personalized service experience . electronics and intelligent network services only improve the efficiency , but can not replace human interaction ." A joint-stock e-banking official said. The JD Power study indicates that , simply use the self-service equipment customers for banking satisfaction and loyalty are low. </p>
						<p> Kim Yu also pointed out in the above article , despite all kinds of new business channels alternative to traditional network channels becomes increasingly apparent , but foreign banks operating practice, physical outlets in meeting customer personalized, differentiated demand , still play a very important role. Multi-channel business strategy emphasizes network services including labor , self-service machines , online banking, mobile banking , telephone banking , social networking , email, and other different business channels and seamless integration . </p>
						<p> " Customers do not come only appearance outlets , banks remained behind various channels in its service , according to data accumulated on the banks analyze customer behavior to determine when customers will come outlets , in order to build networks and contact between customers , forming a closed loop service . " said electronic banking executives believe that only so intelligent to work more effectively . </p>
						<p> Such as China Everbright Bank's " lobby easy" system into the lobby just swipe Everbright Bank cards, real-time user information will be pushed to the lobby manager in the hands of the iPad , which you can understand asset allocation and individual users situation , and to make the appropriate business of its guidance to better prepare potential business marketing . </p>
						<p> Merchants Bank recently launched "mobile banking outlets reserve" function is the same in trying to multi-channel interaction between cooperation , in order to improve network efficiency. China Merchants Bank official says , by means of reservation function , can be reasonably allocated network business resources , while outlets can not time the history of the peak value of the flow of people to design the reservation number , to achieve customer diversion outlets . </p>
						<p class="step"> Bank outlets 3.0 Transition </p>
						<p> 3.0 transformation biggest goal is to achieve outlets ' customer-centric . " </p>
						<p> Although intelligence is perhaps the most banking transformation gimmick label , but not the substance of branch transformation . </p>
						<p> Deloitte in a recent report, this is defined as " branch transformation 3.0 " era, the biggest goal is to achieve the outlets of the " customer-centric ." </p>
						<p> " More of a future as a terminal outlets , like convenience stores , like the latter as a mature retail form, its warehousing, commodity management , customer management, all in the middle and back office , store function is implemented to provide fast , high-quality service bank branches is the same , more of a sales and service nodes . " branch treasure was expressed . </p>
						<p> Words, no matter what technology means to borrow , both as a service outlets showcase , and in the concrete realization of the path , each of the banks impose its laws. CITIC Bank vigorously at this year 's " flagship retail store ", which fought in the customer mind is the case of electronic channels , through a number of physical outlets with the best service, the best experience possible to establish a brand image ; experienced three branch transformation construction Bank , the separation through the front and back , so that the whole process of customer waiting time than before to save 60% ​​- outlets to create customer experience and service are the most essential needs. </p>
						<p> And " customer-centric " transformation of one of the requirements is that the network delivery strategy shift "is not traditional to geographical location decision, but must be based on bank business development strategy , segmenting customers of banks have tiered service outlets targeted to define strategies , network segment as well as the internal functions of different outlets , layout, size and other factors . " branch treasure was said. </p>
						<p> " A network of investment is very high, if only from a business process perspective , do not need to do much of the network input, but if you want to branch banking outlets to achieve greater production capacity , it is necessary to create ' capillary vessels ' like services, strengthen customer loyalty , improve market returns . " the Beijing branch official said the bank's " community "is to achieve this goal . </p>
						<p> Huaxia Bank in 2013 mid-year report also emphasized that " community-based " services. Currently China Beijing Branch are also in the characteristics of the community to build branches of service characteristics, such as branches and Tiantongyuan Zhongguancun branch 's customer base is completely different, the former face is no fixed assets, but there is an IT financing needs of small businesses, while the latter is a huge number of neighborhoods . Therefore, the two types of products and services branch schedule arrangements are also very different . During the day even more emphasis on the elderly Tiantongyuan branch banking products, and plans to launch services will facilitate those who delay came home from work and then apply for the business office workers . </p>
						<p> Number of banks in the pipeline for this year that " community banks " development plan. So far, the Industrial Bank in Fuzhou , Chongqing and other areas are beginning to be deployed , and this month , China CITIC Bank in Chongqing 's first community bank also officially opened. </p>
						<p> " Community-based bank is definitely the direction of development , there are banks during the previous attempt , but did not achieve the economy, while also facing regulatory compliance requirements , which is restricting the future development of the problem. " branch treasure was said. </p>
						<p> Addition, the 3.0 transition is more institutional issues, Deloitte also emphasized in the above report , the network can really release of production capacity , the most critical factor is the Bank's line management mechanism is reasonable and effective , can said branch transformation is not only a " branch transformation" , also called the head office for the appropriate transformation. </p>

						<p> Spacious leisure fabric sofa , leisure areas Shuba in large reading table, rows of new books on the shelves , as well as children's playground red slide ...... see these , you might not think that this is a Bank . These banks not only provide entertainment for the public , but will open until 21:00 work until now, so that more and more banks in Shijiazhuang , they are referred to as community banks . </p>
						<p> Concept of community banks from the United States and other Western financial developed countries, including the "community " is not a strictly defined geographical concept , either refer to a province , a city or a county , city or village can also refer to the residents inhabited area . Any assets smaller scale, mainly for small and medium enterprises operating in the region and household services, local commercial banks can be called small community banks . </p>
						<p> Reporter investigation has learned that Hebei is accelerating the pace of construction of community banks , only nine have been opened in the provincial capital . Although community banks earned applause from all sides , but it faces a number of practical problems, are also plagued the development of community banks . </p>
						<p class="step"> Community banks in a recreation area , the children were playing </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Survey </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1, " Recreation area " area of ​​over business district </p>
						<p> To community residents to provide "community " of services and facilities, is a community bank owned by other banking institutions that are not features. </p>
						<p> In Zhangjiakou , Shijiazhuang City Commercial Bank branch of the high-tech community branches, set up large recreational area , let reporters some surprise : a large reading table, rows of books on the shelves , there is a children's paradise with slides , it occupies the community bank nearly 1/ 2 of the area, while the remaining half is the bank's "good business ." </p>
						<p> To the leisure area , near the area where a lot of children reading and learning . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2, The evening can also apply for access to money business </p>
						<p> " Here does not close until nine p.m. , especially convenient for commuting to withdraw money later ." in the international city district , residential area at the entrance next to the new Li Ruolan comes soon after the community bank , satisfied. </p>
						<p> Li Ruolan said community banks , Zhangjiakou , Shijiazhuang City Commercial Bank branch on solid community branches , the bank opened at International City district, the district where the front is a road , next to an entrance area . </p>
						<p> " Delayed services are a feature of our community banks ." Tan Hou Jing solid community branch president told reporters , in order to facilitate the residents of the business process , reduce customer waiting time , they implement the " 36599 " delayed services, ie, 365 days year round , open as early as 9:00 pm to 9:00 . Initially, at 17:00 after residents came to transact business banking is still relatively small , in the day to do the volume of business that accounted for less than one tenth of the development to the present day, one-third of the basic business concentrated in 17:00 after processing. </p>
						<p> According to Hou Jing introduced in the delay period of service , residents can apply for the bank and the same day all business . The creation of community banks , virtually also led the night economy. Many shops nearby the evening turned out to be six or seven points on the closed, community banks launched a delay in service after many shops have extended hours of operation , every day is closing fast until 21:00 , after which you can put funds not saved to the community bank. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3, Community banks to implement business "zero charge " </p>
						<p> In addition to the internal environment , business hours and conventional banks are different, in some toll on the business , community banks are different. </p>
						<p> Zhangjiakou , Shijiazhuang City Commercial Bank Branch Yang Weidong introduced , they have made customers can enjoy "zero wait , zero distance , zero charge" three zero service , " we tested , the statistics of the peak period for business customers , provisioning good staff , let customers wait , while many community banks cable interface placed in high traffic time , ready to plug in the computer will be able to customers for non-cash business , to achieve zero wait ; for older clients , mobility and other issues, we have taken home services, with customers to achieve zero distance ; our line card at any other bank withdrawals are not charged a fee . in addition, I also removed the line of residents and business services fees , so zero charge . "</p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 4, Banks became part of the community </p>
						<p> " To our own line position , the community bank and our other branches , the biggest difference is that community banks and community residents are more concerned about an integration , the ultimate goal is to be able to community banks as community residents own bank . " Yang Weidong said. </p>
						<p> Summary view, the biggest feature is the community banks around the community, into the community , focusing on the needs of residents launched a variety of fine service , and truly become part of the community . "Only people who have recognized you, then can we talk about business development ." Capital of commercial banks in the community , another branch official said . </p>
						<p> " Spring Festival last year , the line in Zhangjiakou over the teller can not go home reunion, International City neighborhood Wang aunt , after that, the New Year's Eve night, our operating room the girls came home side dumplings . " Hou Jing said happily , " Now, area residents have been put community banks as a home . "</p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Status </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1, Hebei community bank has more than 22 </p>
						<p> Banking Bureau of Hebei Province , according to Deputy Director Yang Jinghui city commercial introduction, community banks like this will not only save , Hebei and other cities there are a lot . Benefiting the community Hengshui City Commercial Bank branch in Hebei 's first community bank , from its opening in 2011 by the end of June this year , Hebei community bank has grown to 22 . Among them, the provincial capital Shijiazhuang have ( 6 ) community bank . However, overall, Hebei community banks are in a starting stage , still in the exploratory period. </p>
						<p> Currently, the community is becoming a city commercial bank restructuring and development of a major focus. City firm in 2013 proposed organization plan, a total of 26 community branches , 10 more than last year , accounting for city planning community branches branches planned 68.42% . The first half of this year alone , there are nine community branch approval or denial . </p>
						<p> A regulators, who also said that 26 community branches are opened, so that Hebei 11 City firm has a community bank , all rolled out . He believes that the community is to promote the city commercial bank restructuring is a useful attempt . As local financial institutions , corporate bodies , the bigger, stronger than the joint-stock banks , however , than the state accusing him , however . But local institutional decision-making shorter, faster restructuring , operational flexibility , you can work on features , doing fine , meticulous market , to seize the other banks do not have the energy or no market. "I have heard there are joint-stock banks have vigorously push community banks in Hebei , community banks can be described as bank restructuring, explore a model ." </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2, The parties are optimistic about the development of community banks </p>
						<p> From the above data, and market reaction, whether it is resident , the bank itself or regulators , for the development of community banks are generally more optimistic . </p>
						<p> " Relative to other banking institutions , community banks to better meet community residents nearby to take deposits withdrawals, financial planning and other business needs ." Hebei Banking Bureau Deputy Director Yang Jinghui city commercial introduction, community banks have close to the market , quick response , flexible decision-making , home care and other advantages are helping to meet the community stalls , shops and other individual industrial and commercial households short, small, frequent and urgent financing needs . In addition , community banks directly within the community , you can be the first time to understand the market demand, improve product development and service innovation focused and effective . </p>
						<p> Insiders also pointed out that community banks are faster urbanization , higher degree of urbanization , urban prefecture-level city reform and development of small and medium financial institutions the direction of the trend of the financial markets . </p>
						<p> Same time, from banking supervision department, the development of community banks also gave strong support . Yang Jinghui told reporters that in recent years , and actively guide the jurisdiction Banking Bureau of Hebei Province City firms adhere to the " service area , service small to serve the community ," the market positioning , focus "inward potential" , and vigorously promote grass-roots extend to actively encourage and support community Bank's development . </p>
						<p> Which , on the establishment of the institutions to community banks inclined to increase the number of branches of the city commercial community ; in the approval process , and opened up a community bank "green channel " to speed up the approval process ; in institutional development , and actively guide and support . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Resolution </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Community banks is how to make money </p>
						<p class="step"> Integrated into the community in order to better understand the market </p>
						<p> Today the capital of the community banks are generally open in the district, away from the city bustling commercial area . </p>
						<p> Same time, many residents and business -oriented service fee is waived , that community banks can make money do ? They are also how profitable it ? </p>
						<p> Zhangjiakou , Shijiazhuang City Commercial Bank Branch Yang Weidong , as of the end of July , Zhangjiakou City Commercial Bank branch in the five communities deposits , has reached 607 million yuan ; Shijiazhuang Branch recommended to small micro-enterprise loans issued nearly 200 million yuan, a total of more than 200 households developing businesses , issuing bank cards 3493 , handling personal online banking and mobile banking 1503 . </p>
						<p> " Our line is positioned on the development of community savings banks , small and micro enterprises, the profit point or interest income ." said Yang Weidong , to the end of July , in Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou City Commercial Bank opened five community banks already two profitable. </p>
						<p> Hengshui City Commercial Bank Gao Lin Yun introduced , and benefiting the community branch from inception to August 22 of this year , a year and a half , during which absorb deposits 225,170,000 ; another community bank Limin branch , established an annual time to absorb the deposit is 126.65 million yuan . </p>
						<p> This two community bank staffed , including the president , including a total of 10 people are . Because there is no loan business , in accordance with the staff size , a community branch of the average daily balance of deposits began to reach more than 60 million profit . And this is basically the opening of two community banks for more than half became profitable . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Bottleneck </p>
						<p class="step"> Existing community banks have become an important development direction City firm </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1, Financial services product innovation capabilities to be improved </p>
						<p> Several community banks from the existing profit model is not difficult to see that, although the parties are very optimistic about the development of community banks , but its profit model of single parties also have to admit that reality. </p>
						<p> Insiders said that if a customer is only enjoy one or two banking products , then the bank of the customer's input costs would not come down , and when banks can offer their customers in a more than five products , the bank will be able to show economies of scope . </p>
						<p> " We are launching ' tailor shop road ' ." Yang Weidong introduced the so-called tailor shops way, that is, for small and medium micro enterprises and individual businesses and community residents to the actual needs , tailored to create financial products. " Zhangjiakou financial needs of residents is not great, Zhangjiakou bank itself is not financial products , came to Shijiazhuang , we investigate the development of a large financial needs Shijiazhuang residents , so we set up a professional team for R & D needs of community residents Money product it will also bring some profit for the bank . "</p>
						<p> Longjiang Bank also said Guan Xihua , development of community banking is undoubtedly the banks, particularly small and medium banks an important future direction of development , but at this stage the development of city commercial banks banking communities still exist certain constraints . Such as community financial services product innovation capabilities to be improved. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2, Community banks economy facing a test </p>
						<p> " Community-based bank is definitely the direction of development , there are a lot of banks during the attempt , but did not achieve the economy, while also facing regulatory compliance requirements , which is restricting the future development of the problem. " Deloitte financial Industry Deputy Director of strategy and operations support treasure was said. </p>
						<p> Although currently there is no better profit model, however, Yang Weidong that city commercial banks to develop community vitality is still very strong . For example , community banks closer to the grassroots level, to understand the financial needs of small and micro enterprises , high-tech branch opened five months community fund balance reached 2.3 million, compared with branches develop even faster . SMEs in the service , community banks will be a powerful tentacles extended . </p>
						<p> " A network of investment is very high, if only from a business process perspective , do not need to do much of the network input, but if you want to branch banking outlets to achieve greater production capacity , it is necessary to create ' capillary vessels ' like services, strengthen customer loyalty , improve market returns . " one banking industry source said the bank's " community "to achieve this purpose, in order to ultimately achieve market returns. </p>
						<p> Deloitte in a recent report also mentioned that the bank branch transformation lies fully grasp the " customer-centric " transformation of ideas, and the combination of retail banking transformation strategy , closely integrated network transformation quantitative and qualitative objectives, systems and processes in the network system , human resources, and other aspects of the Bank's management mechanism designed to co-ordinate and implement the process of introducing change management , unified whole line of steps , to seize an important breakthrough point , in order to achieve the overall network performance improvement. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3, The lack of scientific , overall planning </p>
						<p> Yang Weidong said that for Zhangjiakou banks, community banks in the stone opened up to now is only the first six months of development time , the development of community banks currently still at a superficial level, try the next in -depth community life to improve the quality of the target community needs continuous efforts. Meanwhile, the bank's profitability in the community , the future benefits must be accounted for traditional business is getting low , future profitability is sure to transform , but how transfer remains to be further clarified. </p>

						<p> Post-financial crisis era, the U.S. banking industry 's reputation greatly frustrated that the big banks also frequently scandal broke . But community bank was able to do the opposite, by ordinary consumers and small businesses of all ages. A Data show that in 2012 , despite more than 40 community banks close their doors due to bankruptcy , American Community Bank 's trust index came to 51% up to 55%. </p>
						<p> Manifestation of this trust manifested in many ways , one of which was undoubtedly the account of the transfer. Early last year , in order to oppose the large U.S. banks charge for debit card users a monthly management fee of $ 5 , more than 60,000 customers through social networks campaigning , will own all of the assets of the presence of large banks transferred to community management fee exemption banks and credit unions . This sport is epitomized transfer trend , in 2011 , nearly 5.6 million U.S. customers from their own assets will be transferred to the large banks cheaper community banks and credit unions , making Bank of America CEO had to admit , the big banks have been felt the $ 5 administration fee brings pain. </p>
						<p> Course, not only the big banks felt the threat to community banks , the Fed also found that the financial system in the United States the importance of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had publicly acknowledged that community banks in the U.S. financial system is an important part , especially in maintaining community economic activity and small micro-enterprise financing , played an unparalleled role. In this regard , the Fed set up a Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council ( referred to CDIAC), to strengthen exchanges with community banks and increased government supervision. </p>
						<p class="step"> Street Bank </p>
						<p> Community banks are residents of community-based , people living in rural and urban areas a certain range, according to market principles independent establishment, operation and SMEs to local residents or to provide a convenient , low cost, personalized stronger financial services for small -bank financial institutions . Here the " community " is not a strictly defined geographical concept , can mean both a city and county , it can be inhabited by urban and rural area residents . </p>
						<p> Course, in the United States, the boundaries of community banks is not very clear, only for small commercial banks usually appellation , with multinational banks and national banks separate. Generally speaking, community banks have two basic characteristics , one is a commercial bank , and the second is a smaller scale. But even in the definition of the scale , there are also differences. For example, the U.S. industry generally will total assets of less than $ 10 billion collectively referred to as community banks , according to the Fed's official definition , community banks total assets expanded to $ 10 billion . </p>
						<p> Long been before the outbreak of the economic crisis , the big banks and the U.S. financial sector has been mixed operation 's long-term development goals , whether it is signed in 1980 , " Monetary Control Act " ( to allow mergers between banks mergers and acquisitions ) , or 1999 abolition of the Great Depression " • Glass Steagall Act " ( the bill provides commercial banking and investment banking operations must be discrete ) , both for financial institutions through mergers and acquisitions and other means to create a mixed industry to provide legal support for the financial system , such as JP Morgan Chase , Citibank, Goldman Sachs , the world 's top financial entities to become amazing financial empire . </p>
						<p> Community banks due to their small size and influence of assets , it is impossible to create large banks such as economies of scale . Therefore, with the big banks in the capital market through leveraging and launch complex financial derivatives constantly profiteering different community banks more or rely on traditional profit model - that is, by absorbing short-term deposits and long-term loans to make up spreads . Meanwhile , because of its roots in the community and service to the community for the purpose of community banks mainly involve community residents and SME funds as operating capital . </p>
						<p> This mode of operation and rooted local specialties , so that community banks in the bubble economy era, has been in the role of being eaten , a significant number of community banks can not escape the fate of the merger , according to statistics , in the seventies years, the number of community banks nationwide in about 15,000 or so, but up to now , only less than half survived. But the arrival of the economic crisis , so that large banks suffered heavy losses, but because of their assets and the amount of community banks and the lack of liquidity , regulatory authorities can not bear the required debt ratio , which can only stick to tradition. It is precisely this tradition so that community banks survived the crisis era its stability to operate profitably in the big banks monetary tightening, improve credit threshold but can expand the scale of lending to SMEs . </p>
						<p> The same time, the economic crisis has reversed the people 's point of view , the bigger the better before being considered a financial empire after the crisis has become " too big to fail ", although the brink of bankruptcy , but the government can only take taxpayer money to rescue the market . The community banks both in equity income , bad debt write-off , or the net profit margin , are far more stable . U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a data relative to community banks ( here refers to assets of less than $ 1 billion ) , the probability of bankruptcy of large banks whose seven times , plus in the revitalization of the economy and corporate finance in the community pivotal role played by community banks to the crisis of confidence in the bank 's appreciation is not surprising to regain the industry is the community bank labeled " Main Street Bank (main street banks)", with Wall Street (wal-street) echoed those financial giants . </p>
						<p class="step"> Relationship Banking </p>
						<p> As the movie " Wonderful Life " (It'sa Wonderful Life) (1946 year) , the credit manager George . Bailey to comfort those who worry assets safe deposit customers , very clear to inform them of the money lent their trusted friends and neighbors , as the vast majority of community banks in the United States have focused " relationship banking " (Relationship banking) . This business relies on relationships, with the borrower and its surrounding insider -term interaction, gathering the borrower's personal qualities and management skills and other " soft information " in order to make lending decisions , to meet local residents , SMEs and farmers demand for financial services . </p>
						<p> Community bank engaged in the business relationship has a unique advantage , but also its weaknesses the inevitable choice. Community banks to serve the community for the purpose, rooted in local , community residents and businesses become more familiar with big banks can not match the " information assets " ( Bernanke speech ) , and can greatly solve information asymmetry banks and SMEs conflicts. Many large banks because the opportunity cost is higher, limited information led to moral hazard is too large and other reasons, tend under from the financial statements and credit reports get the " hard information " to lend to businesses . This credit risk is strictly controlled , extremely detrimental to SMEs , because many SMEs do not meet the bank's financing requirements . And then "ground gas" community bank , was able through the relationship banking, understanding of customer changes in income and expenditure situation such as a certain color confidentiality of personal information in order to determine whether the issuance of loans . </p>
						<p> This relationship-based business information , only within a certain range and effectively within a certain scale collection and transmission, in a large organization is difficult , a large variety of levels within the bank is effectively implemented . Rooted in the local community banks , the main source of debt service for local residents and SME deposits, while borrowers are also local businesses and individuals. Since the information in a certain space efficient transitive , not just the banks themselves , and even savings bank upstream customers can always monitor the customer's credit lending standards and operating conditions . As a community bank 's main financing bodies , local small and medium enterprises , the main business scope are mostly concentrated in local , surrounded by neighbors both may fund borrowers. Therefore, relationship banking , not only to alleviate the problem of SME loans , can greatly reduce their violations - because companies want to establish a local customer base a good image. </p>
						<p> Allow borrowers and lenders are closely linked, mutual supervision , community banks are able to guarantee a certain funding sources. Know their flow of money savings customers can rest assured that the money deposited to a local bank . With the trust of customers, small and flexible community banks can boldly seek financing for customers to design more personalized products and services, including: SME loans and agricultural loans , lower-cost checking and some investment products, different types of mortgage and consumer loan products , lower the cost of credit and debit card services , as well as ATMs and electronic banking services. Meanwhile, the community bank attaches great importance to business innovation , in the fierce market competition in order to survive from the past simply deposit and loan business to business diversification, actively develop trust, insurance , securities , consulting and other new services to meet the diverse needs of customers . </p>
						<p> In addition, the development of community banks with local businesses woe economic environment , the investor is also a local private business owners . The higher degree of regional economic activity , community banks will profit the greater the space . Therefore , community banks actively involved in the local economic recovery and revitalization among revitalize the development of SMEs . The local government and parliament is also the local community banks as an important force in the financial system and to win voter support for an important benchmark. </p>
						<p class="step"> Small to fail </p>
						<p> In recent decades, the United States looks more differentiated running a financial system which is half of the country by those who global, highly efficient , diversified financial giants dominated the other half is composed of several one thousand small local banks occupy in the local community engaged in business activities. Like Zhongxinggongyue general, in the United States, about 92 % of banks are community banks , the amount of assets under their control is minimal , and those Wall Street's big banks although few in number , the amount of assets does raspberry. For example, the nation's largest six banks control more than 70 % of the national assets. </p>
						<p> Once upon a time , it is generally considered to become global and diversified banking giant is the right approach , and believe that community banks will eventually be swept out of the stage of history . But in the coming crisis, community banks have been re-examine , and even build a small , local , professional banking became a hot topic. </p>
						<p> If large banks " too big to fail " , then , these community banks is " small to fail ." And such as Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and other large multinational banks, Bank of America is indeed small, poor community . But as the young David defeated giant Goliath , a small bank with its flexible , rooted in local specialties , can not be compared with the role of large banks . First of all, to stimulate economic development and employment promotion perspective, total banking assets accounted for less than 11% of community banks , loans to small businesses have accounted for nearly 40% of the entire industry , which makes its creation employment plays a central role ; addition, when the Wall Street financial giants reputation declined , even when being hated , small banks to serve the real economy, but the style , to a certain extent, to save the reputation of the overall U.S. financial sector , but also to people find another kind of financial entities in the direction of development . </p>
						<p> The advanced nature of the U.S. financial system , to some extent, it is embodied in this have a " too big to fail " and "small to fail" diversification above . The success of the banking sector is reflected in the assets on the one hand , the expansion of financial innovation and even above the other hand, it is also due to the people-oriented , return customers themselves and provide personalized service practice. Community Bank is small, but in the service of local economy and address the financing as well as small and micro enterprises to provide personalized products, strong complement the U.S. financial system improvement and development , so it is definitely the "small to fail ." </p>

					<div class="xx">
						<img src="../../../static/img/jrzx/85.png"/>
						<p> After the first rounds of the contest , the small micro- business has become a new territory each competition , your small and micro businesses are now healthy? Future development , then where ? </p>
						<p class="step"> Five common problems, from speed check : </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 1. Positioning is unclear : the small and micro- businesses , regardless, mismatch phenomenon prominent. </p>
						<p> Many banks micro finance services span is very large, from a few thousands, millions to tens of millions of loans were together ; corporate loans, personal business loans are within the system in one , however, microfinance and micro- lending, taking technical , team , processes , and prices are not the same , business loans and personal loans are not the same audit perspective . Such as micro-credit , pay more attention to credit , in order to focus on the data flow can be taken to focus Approval Mode ; while microcredit must come investigation. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 2. Products collateral-based , market adaptability and product innovation is weak. </p>
						<p> Order to develop a good business , or pay attention to the core needs of customers , and the current collateral-based product design , it is difficult to meet the needs of small and micro class of customers , according to market research, small and micro customers are mainly characterized by : More than 87% of the financing needs of customers , but not more than 90% of customers through banking channels to achieve, mainly because : First, the bank threshold is too high , out of reach ; Second, application information is too complicated ; three is too time-consuming approval cycle long , it is difficult to meet the operational needs ; fact, customers are most concerned about is : Can you lend the money , how long to get the money , how much money they will get , and finally how much to pay financing costs ; financing needs of small and micro enterprises for the common features are: small ( small amount ) ; short ( short-term ) ; frequency ( needs frequent ) ; anxious ( for Requirements fast ) </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 3. Capitation model marketing , bulk single rate, per capita productivity is relatively low. </p>
						<p> To head, personal willingness and ability , single-family based marketing , this way, in the small and micro exhibition industry is a very effective early , but Cadogan competitors , market development, penetration increased, there will be a bottleneck head marketing model : marketing, low efficiency, experience gradual decay , lack of customer acquisition will greatly restrict the amount of per capita production capacity. Many banks do not pay attention to small micro , that does not make money , in fact, did not find a good pattern . </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> 4. Single lending based, not for comprehensive development , resulting in lower overall efficiency </p>
						<p> For customers if we just put a small micro- loans , there is no cross-selling , comprehensive development , will result in customer retention is poor, and just the pursuit of loans , low prices, and less concerned about banks' integrated services. This will cause the customer and the Bank merely lending relationship, and the other into his line of business to go, and once a row of lower interest rate than the Bank , you have watched the hardships marketing to customers instead invest in others embrace. Why Minsheng Bank interest rates go up 30% or even higher , even higher than the other banks , was still able to win customers and earn money ? Because he has a comprehensive development, firmly bind a number of business customers, allow customers to transfer cost increases. If you're only making the loan money, I'm sorry, the future level of interest rates in the local you are not competitive . </p>
						<p> Asked some bankers small and micro business is doing well . Replied that we do well , ah, more than five million non-performing loans only six pen . In my view , such a small micro do not really "small" ; than the defect rate of corporate customers is lower , indicating that the customer is too narrow . If your 1000 loan bad there is only one pen , it means that 1000 document is too good , and will bind business development , you could do 10,000 pen . According to small and micro customers have their own characteristics , you can use the principle of large numbers , price risk coverage , moderate increase in adverse tolerance . But also introduce a third party professional organizations , transferring part of the risk . </p>
						<p class="step"> Do not do the four lines of the " bad student " </p>
						<p> Solve these problems is a priority , and why ? Because time is not on our development of the industry can not wait for your dull. Now small and micro businesses in the same industry eco- what is it ? From the domestic environment, joint-stock commercial banks in the sink. Minsheng Bank six months ago from publicly available data , although still 700,000 , 800,000 loans over the main trend is constantly sinking , many places have been introduced and the main lines of credit less than 500,000 small and micro products. In addition, the letter Campbell CITIC Bank , Beijing Bank Po and other short-term loans , various product lines abound. Postal Savings Bank is also exploring how to do credit . In this situation , leaving a space in the local small and medium banks in the end there is much , for how long , it is worth thinking about . Small banks should have a sense of urgency , accusing him of not fully utilize the short time to enter the market as soon as the customer rings in, integrated development make money from him , then sent interest rates slow down. Do this, accusing him come in when you can sleep well . </p>
						<p> We can not blindly learn the four lines , but also has its own initiative ideas. Brand big four lines , with tens of thousands of outlets, if they have one product we have, we have products that are not firmly without also mentioning the competitive advantage? So do not blindly learning , this will only be four lines of bad student . After all, not qualified , is to learn not in place . </p>
						<p> If we do not learn what kind of road to go do ? Look at the U.S. small and micro business model - Wells Fargo Bank . </p>
						<p> Wells Fargo customers located in the 50 United States and Canada, and transnational business , micro- loan business has 500,000 customers, 70% less corporate customers only five employees , belonging to a small workshop company operating line of credit $ 15,000 average ( amounting to less than 100,000 yuan ) . It went a different path , choose a small micro- loan business , although both single loans of less than 10 million yuan, but the bank has dropped from 88% of the profit contribution of these customers . Micro- enterprises, individual industrial and commercial households Xudai demand, if the first year of the second year can not earn any money , slowly, their operating results will decline. Faced with this client we are again slightly , and then slightly , then down , lying on the ground picking beans do, and not the way to run all the way to pick it up. Small micro is get down to do business, for small and micro customers , to provide a rich product line , such as introduction of credit series , pos credit series, series, operating loans , business loans can continue to classify the 100 , 200 products, many there are that many industry division . For different customer groups , can take different information technology, even different operating procedures, contract version , by different teams to operate , if necessary, cross-marketing . </p>
						<p> Design products, determine the amount of time , the need for system support : through cross- examination , to obtain real data ; After the automatic scoring system ; Imagine how marketers can be equipped with such a system holding an ipad, to any a local business to go , the data input into the system automatic feedback of the customer line of credit available in 50,000 -15 million. You can send one to each customer something similar to credit cards , so that your group was trapping Imagine, many marketers fail because the timing is not such marketing money when customers need , but other customers really need money , and how to let him take the initiative to think of you ? There is such a system and early issuing marketing model, perhaps everything is not the same. Change over time , not rigidly adhere to the inherent model from the perspective of marketing mode , Minsheng Bank five years of play is not the same every year . The first year of holding products to allow customers to go for a run marketing managers from the branch began to promote ; second year began to turn , walk the circle marketing ; third year found scattered single rate down, and can not increase profits or , well , it would take comprehensive development, version 2.0 ; fourth year set up a specialized branch , who turned out to be a marketing team has now become five people , to go and talk district , engage in a big event , with the cooperation model to confirm , a higher level ; to the first five years , he is a co- insurance model mode . We do not need sophisticated marketing approach him one is reasonable, it should look at the whole development paths. It changes every year , rather than introducing a cooperative technology has remained unchanged for decades , so that gets worse . Be sure to flow, the market is changing , competitive environment, customer demand, industry operating conditions are changing , holding a technology regardless of market changes on a way to go black , it will certainly be a problem. </p>
						<p> So small and micro business what you Where is the way ? Really need to take a self- review it must be really wondering customers, according to the customer to make the mechanism innovation, product innovation, marketing model innovation, if the same, I'm afraid this road gets narrower , if the flow, really is a smooth road, to create their own one day . </p>

						<p> Direct current Bank of Beijing Bank of remote intelligent ATMs in Beijing, Nanjing, Jinan , Xi'an Four pilot launch . </p>
						<p> Traditional banks finally began to counterattack internet banking , they chose not to blindly follow the development of the tide line , but chose to enter the direct banking . </p>
						<p> Recently, Minsheng Bank (600016.SH) and Bank of Beijing (601169.SH) successive introduction of Direct Banking , timetables and wiring diagrams are very clear . Whether you believe it or not , like visiting the same 24-hour convenience store to enjoy banking services already reach. </p>
						<p class="step"> Inspiration from overseas </p>
						<p> In financial circles , direct bank considered a new word , but a small micro Minsheng Bank in collaboration with Ali Direct Banking news, so suddenly this strange concept well known to the public . </p>
						<p> 09-16, Minsheng Bank agreed with Alibaba include Direct Banking in multiple areas of strategic cooperation , is expected to near its Direct Banking can be available . </p>
						<p> Direct banking is a truly exotic, born in the late 1990s, the United States and Europe , mainly referring to the establishment of an entity almost no bank outlets , users mainly through the Internet, telephone and other electronic channels to enjoy this virtual bank offers financial products and services. </p>
						<p> In foreign countries, direct bank from time and place convenient and fast, occupy a considerable share of the market , and because there is no physical outlets, direct bank can reduce operating costs , thus providing more favorable prices of financial products , such as higher yielding financial products, lower interest rates and loan products. </p>
						<p> " China Economic Weekly" exclusively learned that the bank Minsheng Bank offer direct inspiration also from overseas. Informed sources told the " China Economic Weekly" , the first half of this year , Minsheng Bank staff study tour to Europe Direct Banking experiences found foreign direct bank , through precise positioning , to meet the financial needs of specific customers , extremely competitive. </p>
						<p> The informed sources , Minsheng Bank's direct banking is ready to learn from this experience, reference to foreign direct banking model, the direct bank made ​​independent bank , the development of online business ( through the Internet to provide customers with financial services ) , for specific target customers financial products. </p>
						<p> Except now the livelihood of fame Direct Bank, First Bank of Beijing Dacheng firm also announced the launch back in September direct banking business , and in Beijing , Nanjing, Jinan, Xi'an Four pioneered pilot. "Whether any time, any region, any network, customers can realize their withdrawal , real estate financial services ." Bank of Beijing Yan Bing , chairman of bamboo in the line of direct bank held the opening ceremony promises. </p>
						<p class="step"> Livelihood fancy Ali customer base </p>
						<p> Argued that direct bank seems more like a new name for the concept of marketing show, with innovation and industry revolution far apart. Because traditional banks have been widely used online direct banking channels is also the most important weapon . And on the surface, direct banking and electronic banking already been separated. </p>
						<p> In this regard, the relevant Minsheng Bank staff told the "China Economic Weekly ", although each bank business electronic replacement rate is already high , appears to have achieved a direct banking functions , but the electronic banking and direct banking is still essentially difference. </p>
						<p> According to the interview , " China Economic Weekly" sorting out the Minsheng Bank version of direct banking and electronic banking two aspects of the traditional distinction . </p>
						<p> First Direct bank does not depend on physical outlets, from the traditional banking organization with independent legal personality . The electronic banking is only a supplement to physical outlets channel or entity relying outlets . </p>
						<p> For example , electronic banking services , customers need physical outlets for bank cards, before you can carry out online banking, mobile banking and other electronic channels of operation. Direct bank bank card is not required , the customer only can register online electronic account is truly virtual accounts. </p>
						<p> Secondly, direct bank only for specific customer groups to provide specific products. </p>
						<p> Take financial products for example , now most of the bank's financial products are mostly large and many species , for a variety of different groups of people , many banks a month to launch a financial product . But the direct banking products concise, only for specific groups of people . </p>
						<p> The Minsheng Bank staff told the " China Economic Weekly" , Minsheng Bank is aimed at the direct sales have " busy, tide, fine," the three major characteristics of the customers, the busy work life , the pursuit of fashion and novelty , and Interest calculation and comparison savvy crowd and positioned in accordance with the above characteristics of design products. In order to establish their own customer base , livelihood options and Alibaba cooperation fancy is the latter's clients. </p>
						<p> 09-16, at Alibaba 's strategy meeting , said that Hong Qi Minsheng Bank , Minsheng Bank Direct Banking can provide rich practical and in accordance with Alibaba or its affiliates customer demand characteristics of financial products , and Alibaba or its affiliates will be responsible for the use of its own channels and resources to vigorously promote the development of China Minsheng Bank direct Banking . </p>
						<p> Reported that Alibaba Minsheng Bank and Minsheng Bank has been opened in Taobao shop direct banking agreement , Minsheng Bank account direct electronic banking and payment systems PayPal account system will interoperate . Effortlessly , Alibaba 's electricity providers give all customers a direct bank Minsheng Banking users . </p>
						<p class="step"> Channels to supplement or independent operators ? </p>
						<p> Operating mode from the point of view , Beijing Bank and Minsheng Bank differ, Beijing Bank direct banking channels, using a combination of online and offline modes , it seems more like a traditional banking channels supplement intended to provide customers with faster and convenient services . </p>
						<p> Beijing Bank Direct Banking channels using a combination of online and offline modes , online channels from the internet banking , mobile banking and other form of electronic service channels ; line using Laying VTM ( smart banking machine ), ATM, CRS ( automatic Teller Machine ) , self-service payment terminals and other self-service equipment, convenience stores as a direct sales channel . </p>
						<p> According to the Bank of Beijing has experienced members of the public about the direct banking services , direct bank cards do not need to queue to the counter , but to ATMs and customer service in real time in front of a video conversation in customer service staff under the guidance of id scanning , signature confirmation and other steps , then get ATMs spit out a new card. You can get the card after online banking, mobile banking and other businesses it. </p>
						<p> Compared to the direct bank Minsheng Bank , Beijing Bank 's direct banking is obviously not independent , many people prefer optimistic Minsheng Bank, but many in the industry view, it is hard to judge which one is better . </p>
						<p> Reporter learned that, despite the Minsheng Bank's vision is to establish a fully independent , real direct bank , but now only as a direct bank electronic banking department under the Ministry of the two . </p>
						<p> Although Minsheng Bank Assistant Governor Lin Yunshan said: " Minsheng Bank has been an independent bank in accordance with the way in preparation for direct banking , once regulatory authorities to issue licenses , direct bank will immediately split ." </p>
						<p> " But it will take some time to achieve the vision , including external financial environment , such as the regulatory authorities to issue licenses ; market understanding of the concept of direct marketing banks , such as the accumulation of a large number of user groups , etc. , which require a step by step to achieve. " the Minsheng Bank staff admits . </p>
						<p> Everything can not help but suspect that a pattern is exactly what the future of Direct Banking ? In this regard, China Merchants Securities analyst Luo Yi believes that direct bank both modes have their advantages , as the traditional banking channels complement format or as a separate bank has its own value . </p>
						<p> Luo Yi believes that the future of direct banking and direct banking related organizational structure . If direct banks as traditional banking sector exists, direct bank will be more reflected in the value of channels ; if direct bank as a separate legal organizations exist, for cost control , will be more toward specialization, differentiation direction development of financial products and services will be simplified. </p>

						<p> Last month , the platform collapse intensified. </p>
						<p> No barriers to entry , no industry standards, no regulatory agencies ...... P2P net loan "innate " inadequate , "acquired" a lack of self-discipline and supervision, barbaric growth of P2P industry risk is constantly increasing . </p>
						<p> P2P industry called self-discipline and supervision. The recent news that regulators are developing relevant policies, the future is likely related to the introduction of Internet-based financial regulatory policies , while P2P is a financial Internet . </p>
						<p> "80% of P2P companies opened in the third-party payment platform accounts, this intermediate account funds sedimentation problem is systemic risk in the industry , which is in the introduction of policies regulators need to consider the issue ." in 2013 in China microfinance Alliance annual meeting, said Shi Jun Chang , CEO credits . </p>
						<p> Communications CEO Lanci paid in 2013 global financial summit, said the Internet , P2P risk comes from two aspects, one is the risk of creditor and debtor , the second is the risk of the platform itself . We worked with the People's Bank official had discussed whether the use of payment institutions , to guard against the risk P2P platform . " We're now in the joint development of such a solution ." </p>
						<p class="step"> Shuffle acceleration </p>
						<p> Last three years, the net loan amount platform with 400% growth rate. This year it is growing into an incredible speed , "Earlier this year , when net lending platform to increase a day or two , and now three to four each day , a month to 100 on-line platform is expected by year's end national network of lending platform will exceed 800 , while in 2010 only 20 institutions only . " net loan house founder Xu Hongwei said. </p>
						<p> In fact, the entire P2P industry , whether it is the number of platforms on the line , or the rapid growth in total loans . "Platform Total volume at an annual growth rate of 500% in 2010 to 600 million yuan , is expected to total industry volume in 2013 will reach 100 billion to 120 billion yuan ." Xu Hongwei think , P2P rapid development , an important source because of civil lending " network" , using the Internet to bypass the restrictions of the financial barriers to entry . " With this wave of Internet-based financial stocks , qualified private lending institutions may use the Internet to lend. 5 years after the Chinese net loan volume may be more than 10 trillion yuan ." </p>
						<p> In the number and size of loans rapid growth, the net loan platform reshuffle is also accelerating . </p>
						<p> " After the November holiday , has been 11 net loan platform collapse , the average daily one ." October 27 Xu Hongwei said that the future is also likely to exacerbate the situation , " a month after the collapse of 100 possible . "</p>
						<p> " General closure is a new platform for on-line soon , they are to attract popularity, interest rates out to 30% to 40%, some even up to 60%, while the old platform, relatively low interest rates , and some 15% the investment should exceed the rate of return to normal operation platform , given that high interest rates , the new platform does not fall strange , so then that is a Ponzi scheme . " one Shanghai 's net loan industry, said that those on foot platform , some outset fraud , some uncontrollable own risk. With the on-line platform to increase net lending , failures are bound to increase the number of platforms , shuffle may eventually leaving dozens net loan platform . </p>
						<p> Nanjing, a P2P executives told reporters that now the industry's marketing staff to borrowing rebate ends in 5 to 6 points , in actual operation , plus wage costs , in fact, the cost of marketing staff of nearly 8 points much , which also pushed down borrowing rates rise. " Companies always have to make money , right ?" </p>
						<p> Addition, the new platform first month average of the borrowing period significantly shorter than the old platform , mainly in its borrowing period from January to March . Xu Hongwei introduced early to peer lending represented by the traditional old platform, if borrowers need three months or six months, they will send three months or six months of the standard, but in the current competitive market case, the new platform not only for the amount of on-line split , while the deadline for processing, " demolition of the standard " has become the industry new term. But the " demolition of the standard " platform will bring liquidity risk issues, such as , lending out money three months, but the platform made ​​a month mark , if investors want to advance payment , the platform may occur liquidity risk.</p>
						<p> Vice chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic Committee , says Wu Xiaoling , demolition of illegal fund-raising target way escape asset securitization , and illegal substance . </p>
						<p> To solicit business regardless of the risk , many P2P platform ultimately to the collapse . Recently Orient Ventures , Sichuan credit , commercial loans and many other desirable P2P platform broke questions Tianli loans chairman Liu Mingwu , in " deposits from the public ," was formally opened . </p>
						<p class="step"> Urged regulators </p>
						<p> In fact, this is barbaric growth of the industry, there are many problems and risks. </p>
						<p> China Du Xiaoshan Microfinance Alliance chairman pointed out , P2P industry in the " three noes " status: no barriers to entry , no industry standards and self-regulation, no supervision. </p>
						<p> Du Xiaoshan that domestic P2P mode from abroad is carried out innovation, but these innovations have brought many problems : the line and guarantees, etc. , undermine the advantages of P2P , so that the transaction costs and price convergence with the private lending market ; some P2P platforms provide direct guarantees , financing guarantee from the regulation would increase systemic risk ; appear illegal fund-raising business model , the formation of strangers brought together many credit funds asset pool ; various traditional folk name of the P2P lending appears to industry a huge systemic risk ; appear Ponzi fraud and other fund-raising activities as possible. </p>
						<p> Currently , P2P industry itself has begun to try to establish industry standards. Guangdong Internet Finance Association ( chips ) president Baoguo introduction, Guangdong Province, Internet Finance Association inaugurated soon . According to informed sources, thousands of Internet banking will be based in Beijing also strive to set up Internet Finance Association , P2P industry that is one of the integral plate. Du Xiaoshan , also said China Microfinance Alliance has also established an internal self-discipline Convention P2P agencies . </p>
						<p> Seeking self-discipline , the " external regulatory conditions are ripe ." Du Shan said , "Now the regulatory authorities on this issue is how to do intensive discussions , the information coming from quite positive ." </p>
						<p> In fact , recently, the regulatory authorities of the P2P industry, intensive research is being expanded. Hongling Zhou Shiping , chairman of venture capital , said the central bank responsible person in the research , pointed out that as long as the P2P net loan platform do illegal things , the future will likely produce as large enterprises like Tencent . </p>
						<p> Which may come in the future regulation of industry professionals held more welcoming attitude . Du Xiaoshan called P2P sector management as soon as possible guidance or temporary measure, to determine regulatory agencies , when appropriate , legislation, or the introduction of the "Network loan management approach ."</p>
						<p>" If you set the corresponding entry barriers , industry major reshuffle , giving marketers unreasonable rebate can be reduced , which also helps to control risk ." Nanjing P2P aforementioned company executives say , this threshold can refer to the security company financing leveraged setting , according to the loan balance setting fallback ratio. </p>
						<p> " Known good that several P2P, each operating expenses will not be less than 10 million yuan , from the foot of the platform, 99% of bosses in jail , in fact, now the industry threshold is not low ." wing long Loan CEO Wang Sicong remind newcomers , P2P venture risky , do not think to make quick money . </p>
						<p> The informed sources , the preliminary findings have been reported to the regulators , the State level may be introduced in the future related to regulatory policies. </p>
						<p> ZOPA chairman Phillip Riese recently to China, met a lot of P2P industry and regulators, who , in contrast to the Anglo-American regulatory his experience that over-regulation of the U.S. industry oligopolistic structure P2P , while Britain has many the new company can join the former than the latter industry innovation capability . </p>
						<p> " Favorable regulatory measures should be ' oversight ' instead of ' supervision '." </p>

						<p> " Golden age and Chinese banking industry is closely related to the economic cycle . economic decisions, financial , economic reform in transition at the same time , the banking industry faced unprecedented challenges ." chairman of the Hong Kong Wing Lung Bank , China Merchants Bank president Ma Weihua ago at yesterday's " 2013 summer Davos • European night ", said . </p>
						<p> Ma Weihua said the catastrophe facing death need for restructuring of the banking sector , in particular, need to improve risk pricing and customer service capabilities. </p>
						<p class="step"> Chinese banking catastrophe in case of death </p>
						<p> " Economic decisions, financial , economic reform in transition , while also experiencing unprecedented financial challenges, I managed banks in recent years clearly felt a lot of pressure ." Ma Weihua said in a speech . </p>
						<p> In Ma Weihua opinion, the current Chinese banking sector has to be reformed in order to meet the challenge of timing , and here the challenge that comes from the macroeconomic environment , there are also regulatory environment and market demand factors . </p>
						<p> First, the macroeconomic environment , the external environment inevitable economic slowdown reduced demand ; Second, China is also experiencing the stage of bank disintermediation , on the one hand is the capital disintermediation ; hand is a technical disintermediation ; their three is the regulatory constraints . </p>
						<p> From the macro environment as well as China 's financial market is undergoing change , the Ma Weihua that interest rate market will bring vital test of China's banking sector . </p>
						<p> " China's banking sector in the past is considered the most profitable industry , which is a very important reason is that the interest rate controls , the bank's profit model is mainly spreads , interest rate controls of a result is homogeneous competition among banks , only by allowing competitive differentiation between the industry , relying on differentiation and price competition to the market allocation of resources . " Ma Weihua said. </p>
						<p> But past experience, many countries have experienced the process of marketization of interest rates are banking Ebb Tide process. </p>
						<p> U.S. interest rates in the 1980s occurred during the market a large number of bank failures in the situation , China Taiwan is also a collective loss , "If the mainland into Taiwan's current level of interest rates that is 1.5% , the China Banking in profitable much . " Ma Weihua said frankly . </p>
						<p> Ma Weihua great length in his speech on the current banking disintermediation facing pressure, especially the banking disintermediation technical challenges . </p>
						<p> In the past 10 years, the bank loans of the total social financing scale of 95% , but in the first half of this year , this figure has been reduced to about 60%, due to bank deposits moving, rapid development of the bond market , financial products and trusts, private lending have also experienced a rapid development . </p>
						<p> And compared to capital disintermediation , Ma Weihua considered to Facebook disintermediation represented technical challenges posed by the banks was more threatening . </p>
						<p> " Face recognition with one billion customers, through search engines, credit system , cloud computing, mobile terminals and other technology development and application , can be a good pairing the deposit and loan pricing and risk , which banks are most core business challenges . " Ma Weihua said. </p>
						<p> Last century , Bill • Gates has boldly predicted , "If you do not change the words of the traditional bank , you are a group of 21 century perishing dinosaur ." This phrase became the motto of Ma Weihua , has become China Merchants Bank to build its retail system where power and pressure , but " now the banks have encountered death catastrophe ." </p>
						<p> Addition, Ma Weihua pointed out that since the financial crisis , the global banking regulatory impact on the banking sector also bring great pressure to run the bank's capital . </p>
						<p> " Basel Ⅲ on bank capital adequacy requirements to further improve , leading to all banks require additional capital , but the capital market on the banks very scary , in this case, the bank will turn to conserve capital for SMEs , but pricing power on the bank's risk and challenges to achieve the centralization of credit , batch processing . " Ma Weihua said. </p>
						<p class="step"> New challenges and changes </p>
						<p> " Bank changes in external environment , constraints change, and changes in market demand , it was decided the bank must change ." Ma Weihua said the current Chinese banking proposal . </p>
						<p> Ma Weihua that banks need to consider and adapt to changes in the six . </p>
						<p> The first is the interest rate market change has been the homogenization of competition , relying on market prices to more reasonable allocation of resources. </p>
						<p> Second is the integration of banking and refined , with the reduction in bank credit assets , the bank 's reliance on spreads era has ended , and now needs to provide a lot of services transformation , so you need to modify the existing Law on Commercial Banks . </p>
						<p> The third is to take full advantage of the opportunities internationalization of the RMB , the use of Chinese enterprises to go out of the opportunity to provide and enhance cross-border financial service capabilities. </p>
						<p> The fourth is a diversified financial stake . Current greater emphasis on domestic financial market reform and opening up , including private institutions into the financial sector , which gives banks more opportunities and challenges , "the bank can no longer follow past earnings model, but needs to be eye- opening ." Ma Weihua said. </p>
						<p> Which five are multi-level capital market . " To build the motherboard other than the GEM, small board coexist multi-level capital market, China 's financial market requires multi-level , banks can support these growth-oriented technology companies ." </p>
						<p> Its Sixth asset securitization . Now the volume of China's banking industry generally too large, taking up a lot of capital , capital through securitization can be vacated ; while also rich trading in financial markets products. </p>
						<p> " Economic transformation will inevitably bring about the transformation of banks , the banks may be more emphasis on the transformation of our customers, increasing emphasis on financial services ." Ma Weihua concluded. </p>

						<p> 2013 Summer Davos Forum opening ceremony this afternoon at the Dalian International ( 7.13 , 0.07 , 0.99% ) Plenary Hall Convention Center , Premier Li Keqiang at the opening ceremony of a special speech . Premier Li Keqiang said in a question and answer session to promote financial reform to advance the reform of financial institutions , in particular, to expand market access ; promote the cultivation of multi- level capital market development , expand investment and financing channels ; strengthen financial regulation and choose the launch deposit insurance system. </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Following Li Keqiang Question and Answer Record : </p>
						<p> Speech ended, Premier Li Keqiang returned to their seats , Schwab in his seat to Prime Minister Lee questions. [2013-09-11 18:00] </p>
						<p> [ Schwab ] to thank the Prime Minister ! I would like to take this opportunity to ask you two more questions . My first question is, China 's financial system can be described as involved in all aspects of the Chinese economy can be said that the reform of the financial system in China , " indeed affect the whole body ." I would like to ask the Prime Minister , the Chinese how to further promote financial reform ? [2013-09-11 18:01] </p>
						<p> [ Li ] just my topic called " reform and innovation to drive long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy ." Chinese economy is to achieve long-term sustainable and healthy development, we must rely on reform . Contains a comprehensive reform of economic reform, economic reform which is an important element of financial reform , which is a complicated systematic project . </p>
						<p> Because it is a complicated systematic project , also shows that China 's reform has entered a deep water area , a crucial stage. Therefore, we must not only courage , but also have the wisdom , to seek and seize the " pull one over" reform. We are not afraid of difficulties , nor Xili , not trying to do just coincidence , with half the times . But we are willing to seek out a trick that can affect global and even lose all live effects. </p>
						<p> In the financial system reform , to seize the key and difficult or that is the key issue , will help promote economic reform , it will affect China 's economic and social aspects of life , and promoting the comprehensive reform deepened. [2013-09-11 18:05] </p>
						<p> [ Li ] Our next step is to promote the financial system, the key is to adhere to the basic orientation of market-oriented reforms , and actively and steadily push forward interest rates , exchange rates in the market, and gradually promote the RMB capital account convertibility. </p>
						<p> But also to promote the reform of financial institutions , in particular, to expand market access , allowing a variety of ownership of financial institutions with more space for development , but also the multi-level financial system to nurture . </p>
						<p> Just as there are trees nature , there are grass. There multinational business community , there are also small and micro enterprises . Financial system should also be established ecological circle, there are small cycles , both big banks , there are small banks, rural banks and even there . So that you can more fully and effectively support enterprise development in support of economic development entities , is conducive to more jobs and increase incomes of the population . [2013-09-11 18:10] </p>
						<p> [ Li ] Next, we need to actively promote the cultivation of multi-level capital market development . China 's savings rate is now relatively high, which has a good side , there are also disadvantages. We are continuing to take measures to expand domestic demand and stimulate consumption , but also hope that through effective measures to optimize the investment structure, increase investment efficiency. This need to increase the proportion of direct financing , so that the community , businesses and individuals have more investment channels. That is, to expand investment and financing channels, so that society , enterprises and individuals have more choices, the market more dynamic. [2013-09-11 18:12] </p>
						<p> [ Li ] we talked about financial reform , they also can not forget the need to proceed with the financial regulation . I have just talked about five years ago, the international financial crisis . Economic development needs financial support, but the financial crisis will seriously impact the economy running smoothly. </p>
						<p> Fact, strengthen financial supervision is itself a reform . We will improve the financial regulatory system , strengthen financial supervision and coordination mechanism , and choose the launch deposit insurance system, to firmly hold the non-occurrence of systemic , regional financial risk the bottom line , your savings , investors in the future have a stable, expected returns. After all, the financial system is to benefit the real economy , is conducive to restructuring, so that more people benefit . Thank you ! [2013-09-11 18:15] </p>
						<p> ( More from Xinhua ) </p>
						<p class="secondStep"> Attached: private banks by policy support </p>
						<p> According to Chinese news report , recently , the CBRC issued " Chinese commercial banks administrative licensing matters Implementation Measures" , initiated the establishment of domestic financial institutions to relax the conditions for banks . Meanwhile, the State Department was first proposed by the private capital to promote the attempt initiated by banks . Level of public funding for the establishment of the Bank's policy attitudes increasingly uncertain , causing many enterprises of the " Private Banks Dream" chase </p>.
						<p> Statistics show that China's current 373 mainstream commercial banks 96% are central government, local governments, large state-owned enterprises and local governments platform company holding. In the 12 joint-stock commercial banks, only Minsheng Bank is a private bank . With economic development, this state- control mode to a certain extent has become the economic development of resistance , for example, it is difficult for SMEs to provide a fair financial services. </p>
						<p> Today, private capital into the financial sector has entered the countdown stage . Central University of Finance and Professor Guo Tian Yong believes that private banks can not help bank financial institutions initiated the establishment , but by private capital to lead the establishment , which could be a major breakthrough in the future of financial reform . </p>
						<p class="step"> Existing shareholding structure of defects </p>
						<p> State-owned commercial banks in the transformation of China's economic reform can no longer play an important role , and may become economic reform resistance. </p>
						<p> " Dominance ." Under the current system a single commercial bank ownership structure , can not form their duties, effective checks and balances of the operating mechanism. </p>
						<p> Commercial banks big but not strong . Under the care of the government , not China 's HSBC nurturing . </p>
						<p> " Going out , international" difficult. Western society is more recognized market behavior , rather than government action. At present, China 's banking sector remains strong administrative colors. </p>
						<p> Commercial banks under the current system and private enterprises , small and micro enterprises , new market without a common language , which is difficult to obtain timely and effective financial support and financing services. </p>
						<p> Economic turmoil , crisis occurs commercial bank risk will pass a huge impact on the government , will give the potential pressure on government finances . </p>
						<p class="step"> Lowering the threshold for the establishment of private banks </p>
						<p> The original small loan companies or rural banks promoted to private banks in the local culture by private capital as the main sponsor of the private bank , financed entirely by private enterprises in rural credit cooperatives choose to sell all the shares of private enterprises , and through restructuring enhance the establishment of private banks. </p>

						<p> These days, the Internet banking has become a hot topic. Some say that this is a fundamental challenge to the traditional bank assertion banks should be overturned . Some even say that the further development of Internet banking , it will replace the existing form of indirect financing and direct financing , banks, brokerages and exchanges and other financial intermediaries will no longer work , and even the central bank's monetary issue features will be replaced. </p>
						<p> So many people eager to want to join in Internet banking, that this is a rare opportunity. While others simply say , when the financial sector is to " showstopper ." </p>
						<p> Reason why I believe that the current situation should first be sure that it is as information technology innovation and rapid advances in Internet-enabled the formation of the trend , and thus produce these phenomena has its historic ; Second, we it should be noted that many of the people on the so-called Internet-based financial knowledge is not comprehensive enough , not enough to fully understand the market some of the sayings and doings of a certain blindness obviously Strip , which is currently a lot of phenomena may only stage. </p>
						<p> Fact so far , what is Internet banking is no uniform definition. It stands to reason through the Internet to operate all financial services should be included in the "Internet banking " category. But our market is currently seem to be more specific to the Internet banking Internet companies involved in the financial industry as carried out by those businesses. Research on these concepts and clearance may need to take time . </p>
						<p> Just trying to talk about this on the internet financial development in the process, banks have done , Internet companies are doing, especially want to talk about some of the mode of operation of the Internet presence of financial risks and hazards, talk to the Internet strengthen supervision of financial necessity and urgency . </p>
						<p class="step"> Bank behind it? </p>
						<p> Many people believe that banks, especially China's commercial banks is a traditional industry with intense colors , the bank 's understanding and application of the Internet , on the understanding of the concept of big data is not enough. I believe that this view biased. Although the bank's business processes , there are many areas for improvement , the bank should also further improve the efficiency of services , but frankly , in our country before the advent of Internet companies , banks have set up their own national computer network . </p>
						<p> After As information technology innovation and continuous development of Internet technology , the bank is through the public Internet and their corporate and national networks, as to achieve the business operations and management of comprehensive information , data oriented , and thus the coverage extends from the domestic to the world . </p>
						<p> Take the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , although there are now more than 17,000 business institutions , but through online banking, telephone banking , mobile banking, self-service banking channels such as handling the volume of business has accounted for 78% of total business volume , rather to replace the more than 30,000 physical outlets. </p>
						<p> China 's banking sector is not, as some people imagine, we do not use Internet technology , the lack of ability to integrate various types of data analysis . Chinese banks should be completely and also conditional on the internet financial rise of the process, to further accelerate their own development. </p>
						<p> Chinese banks in the use of information network technology to provide financial services , implementation of internal management is not outdated and is move on. Furthermore, it should be noted that Internet companies involved in financial services from the bank actually rarely based services to handle , for example, third-party payment companies still need to pass client authentication information of the bank's customers , funds transfer and clearing the must be done through the banking system , and so on. </p>
						<p> In short, these problems should have a comprehensive knowledge and understanding. Therefore, the author 's view is that banks have been gas asserted conclusion is untenable. But banks must also ensure that the times, the flow, can continue to play in the social and economic life bigger and better role. </p>
						<p class="step"> How Internet companies involved in financial services ? </p>
						<p> At present, China 's Internet companies engaged in financial services can be basically classified into class settlement , financing categories, finance and investment insurance and other categories . And in each category can be carried out according to the specific business model some segments . As for the virtual currency in China has not yet come into vogue this temporarily for more involved . </p>
						<p> In payment and settlement business, first of all those who rely on their own online shopping site developed integrated payment platform. Such platforms with online payment , remittance , secured transactions , life payment, mobile payment and other functions , represented by "Alipay ", " TenPay " and so on . </p>
						<p> Followed by independent third-party payment platform. Behalf of the enterprise of " fast money ", " IPS ", " PayEase ", "lakala" and so on. Such payment platform is not usually own shopping website, the main payment services through a variety of services to its merchant partners . </p> <p> in the financing business , the type many different structures . For example P2P mode , P2P net loan , originally refers to the network platform and completed micro-lending transactions . P2P has a normal single transaction amount is small, both supply and demand in individual , small business -oriented features . </p>
						<p> Maximum current media reports , the network is the most hot to "Ali small loan" as a typical representative , based on the information gathering and processing capabilities and the formation of financing models . It relies on the traditional financial collateral or security model is different from the main electricity supplier platform based on transaction data, social network user information and behavior analysis and processing to form a network credit rating system and risk calculation model , and accordingly to the network business orders issued loans or credit. </p>
						<p> Alternative financing model can be called supply chain finance model , represented as " Jingdong Mall ." In this mode, the electronic business platform only information intermediaries , do not assume financing risk. </p>
						<p> Addition to the above several major network financing model , the country also appeared similar to the U.S. Kickstarter, through the network platform directly " to the public finance" , "let creative people to obtain funds " approach , such as " roll call time "," net benefit "and other Internet companies . Current size are not large . </p>
						<p> In investment banking, insurance business, one is released loans for financial institutions , funds or insurance product information , information intermediaries undertake or engage in fund and insurance distribution business . On behalf of enterprises "melt 360 ", "good credit network" information service , as well as " a few meters network", " copper street" , "every day fund" and other fund distribution sites. </p>
						<p> Another is the existing financial products and the Internet combined with the characteristics and the formation of investment products or insurance products. To " balance treasure " and " Zhong An online ," the shipping insurance , fast payment fraudulent insurance and other representatives. </p>
						<p class="step"> These works have Risk ? </p>
						<p> Must be affirmed , with the continuous progress of scientific and technological means , Internet companies can be more efficient in financial services to understand the user 's needs and preferences , which in innovation, integration and customization services to banks and other financial institutions, traditional service model both brought no small challenge , it also brings a lot of inspiration. </p>
						<p> Now need to note that in all of us fully affirmed the financial convenience of the Internet at the same time , whether a certain extent, ignored the security - even for a moment that any financial transactions indispensable basic principles. Corresponds to the previously listed some of our current Internet-based financial model, further analysis and understanding of potential risks they might be necessary . </p>
						<p> Such payment class business, some third-party payment agencies only users in the user registration page, enter the payment institution certificate information , bank card number and account password in payment institutions , this approach is difficult to verify the customer's true identity , their safety several levels lower than the banks , especially the payment process to be followed is difficult to effectively implement anti-money laundering laws and regulations . </p>
						<p> Some third-party payment platform conducting large transfer of funds , they do not need to use the U Shield and other security verification tool ( which is precisely summarize years of banking experience , lessons learned and to stick with a lot of security measures ) , but simply bound phone customer entries received dynamic checksum , and even third-party payment account password to complete the transfer of large sums of money . </p>
						<p> Had repeatedly occurred in recent years, without authorization from the customer's account customers planning to go on a huge amount of money of the case. And other relevant departments under the central bank deposits and other funds on the customer 's requirements should be implemented custody , for various reasons it has been difficult to really implement . </p>
						<p> Another example is the class of financing business, took P2P , apart from some P2P platform also insisted on not guarantee , does not assume the credit risk , there is now a growing number of organizations have to face it with P2P financing funds intermediation and guarantee functions , but due to the lack of monitoring of their funding sources , and no act of P2P lending institution 's capital constraint , the risk is self-evident. </p>
						<p> Recently the occurrence of certain events on foot from the net loan companies , involving net loan company through the investor , the registered capital , the borrower fraud and other important information to lure customers fooled. Currently many P2P companies have declared their financing is very low default rates , but in fact rely on the pool of funds behind the structures , credit risk is constantly accumulating . </p>
						<p> There credit business in the network has great influence on the market platform is the core of its risk control data integration, model building and quantitative analysis , it is within the network itself through customer transaction data ( eg customer evaluations level data , shipment data , reputation evaluation, etc. ) and some external data ( such as customs , taxation , electrical aspects of the data ) integration process , the use of credit evaluation model to calculate the potential borrower 's probability of default , and thus how the lending criteria as . </p>
						<p> Should be said that this idea is in line with the development of Internet banking law , but in practice there are also some potential risks. This platform is currently relying on data mainly by their electricity supplier business-related transaction data structure, data is more a single dimension , effectiveness, but also lack of data on the B2B is lacking. </p>
						<p> In addition , compared with the banking industry has accumulated a decade or so of data , these Internet companies in particular, the lack of long-term data to support across the economic cycle , the current net loan company's risk measurement model reliability has yet to be tested. </p>
						<p> Investment and wealth management is the most typical and most influential when the number of Internet banking in the country this year, the emergence of a business model, in this model, third-party payment agencies will existing customer deposits converted into currency funds and other investment products. Because of its clients 'deposits can not solve the problem of interest , and thus has been welcomed by customers , but it also achieved third-party payment mechanism to absorb clients' funds purpose, which is what they want. </p>
						<p> But it is still possible risks of their lack of knowledge . Not to mention that they are currently publicize its annual yield can reach 4% , higher than bank deposit interest rates , while the risk is enough to reveal whether the practice compliance, whether it would be misleading to investors on their investment in the Fund is not reach the expected yield loss or even the possibility is there. </p>
						<p> Recently took place in the capital of this platform, users are transferred to other accounts designated cases , the user a claim , and the network enterprise requires the user must prove that the loss of funds "can not be attributable to the customer's own cause" be compensated. The emergence of such disputes also shows that any person engaged in the business of financial institutions do not give in easily , " foolproof ." </p>
						<p class="step"> Need to strengthen supervision ?
						<p> Current Internet banking, in the field of finance , P2P institutions are rapidly expanding the use of social capital in improving efficiency while also accumulating credit risk, the borrower defaults difficult to recover , P2P agencies are not uncommon on foot is a typical event examples. </p>
						<p> Order to promote long-term healthy development of Internet banking , security and stability to the financial system requires attention to the Internet from now on the outside of the financial regulation and industry self-regulation , can not be left to its unfettered " barbaric growth ." To prevent and correct that mistake strengthen financial regulation of the Internet , just do not support innovation, it will hinder solve the problem of financing small and micro enterprises one-sided understanding . </p> <p> such as payment and settlement business , according to the " non-financial institution payment service management approach " requirement, China's " pay monetary funds transferred between institutions shall entrust banking financial institution , not by paying mutual institutions storing monetary funds or other forms of payment institutions entrust other handle . " </p>
						<p> But in fact a lot of third-party payment companies current practice does not comply with this provision, also did not get special permission from the relevant departments . So long as the management approach has not been modified , it should prohibit such phenomenon exists . In addition , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the regulatory authorities , in order to prevent and control risks , the user through third-party payment companies quick payment operations , the need for real-name authentication through banks . </p>
						<p> But third-party payment company has always been to facilitate customers unwilling to comply with the regulatory authorities in the name of this provision , and even banks fall-back alternative approach , that first payment certification, subsequent payments do not accept the practice is no longer certified , which obviously , there are many potential risks . </p>
						<p> Another example is in business financing side, there are also a number of lending without barriers to entry , no industry standard , non- regulatory agency of the "three noes" state. Such as the implementation of strict regulatory capital adequacy ratio is currently the international financial institutions, loans against assets business constraint measures, but although some P2P institutions assume credit risk, is not subject to similar constraints , there is no provision requirements. </p>
						<p> Another example in investment and wealth management business, the lack of such products is strictly prohibited disguised deposits provisions ; lack of funding sources and application of its strict requirements and monitoring ; their propaganda must be fully disclosed in the risk of regulatory requirements also is not clear , nor against its liquidity risk regulatory means . </p>
						<p> In summary , the author's basic point is that the concept of online financial needs further clarification ; networks need to further regulate the financial model ; networks need further regulation of financial operations . Only this , the network in order to maintain good financial momentum now in the ascendant , can be healthy , safe and orderly sustainable development. In this historic process among the supervisory authorities , banks and Internet companies have their own responsibilities and obligations. </p>

						<p> Guotai Junan Securities chairman Wan Jianhua that China's financial reform should follow the development of the Internet within the financial requirements of the policy of tolerance for Internet innovation , support for cross-border development . </p>
						<p> Wan Jianhua September 27 in the " 2013 China Financial Innovation Forum", said the Internet , big data , cloud computing, mobile Internet and other information technology for the Internet to prepare the conditions for financial innovation . IT gave birth to electronic payments specialization trends , financial electronic commerce booming banking products increasingly common phenomenon . </p>

					<h1 class="H1">Make two key platforms</h1>
					<div class="zz">Author：admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published：2013-11-19 13:26:00</div>
					<div class="xx">
						<p> Platform model so attractive , but it is also one of the hardest successful strategy. </p>
						<p> First, select the platform strategy, companies need to have the ability to accumulate huge scale users. Need to get at least the first peer -scale users, this is a very big challenge . </p>
						<p> In my experience, to be in a big market that we do not only need the first user scale excellent products , users also need to just fit the strong demand of the market opportunity, or even need to find effective marketing tools, from a certain kind of perspective is scarce . </p>
						<p> Second, you need to provide to the user a huge sticky service. In general , as long as the user needs to provide a strong enough product success , but if you want to make platform to provide users with products alone is not enough , these enterprises must be service-oriented enterprises, but should serve the user's hard- demand , in fact, only a handful of such services is intense competition can be imagined. All technical barriers are theoretically can be copied . Stronger is to build their own comprehensive barriers. </p>
						<p> Chinese people are used to "eat food alone ," but the so-called platform is built for others , and let others make money . In short, the platform needs to do is " virtuous " rather than "the gun out of the regime ," only do not do a thing or partners than their partners when they could make more cost-effective percent. </p>
						<p class="step"> Detonated " platform strategy " combat manuals </p>
						<p> Platform mode start-up period , the platform companies often face the "first first, the chicken or the egg " problem . Which side in the end of the first groups to come induction ? First, we must understand the platform ecosystem healthy growth must rely on multilateral market model , so in the development process , it is indeed the lack of traditional linear value chain "strategic flexibility ." </p>
						<p> Exist in the platform ecosystem in the correspondence between the at least two ways: the sides negotiate the relationship between each group ; each side platform for enterprise groups and negotiate relationships . Platform on which companies can decide for themselves which side of the market during the course of betting more effort . The pointer which is to determine which side the user has more right to speak . </p>
						<p> Platform enterprise itself the right to speak is slowly accumulated . First evaluation platform connecting companies relative privilege multilateral market becomes critical . Only in this way , the growth of strategic development platform steps in order to be effectively estimated. However, it is worth mentioning is that sometimes one side of the market groups also may be a " counterattack " in the hope that inhabit its ecosystem for "reform ." </p>
						<p> Users may want a substantive impact on the enterprise platform , such as forcing companies to reduce barriers to entry platform fees , or change some of the mechanism , but the prerequisite is that the size of the group must be large enough . </p>
						<p> Single market only when a sufficient scale , it may require enterprises to adjust the platform ecosystem infrastructure to meet its expectations. But interestingly , often in the group reaches a certain size , it is also a platform for enterprise development phase transformation down . The side population growth not only to enhance the size of their right to speak negotiate with the platform , but also enhance the platform for the enterprise itself the right to speak . Because the platform has a more dazzling ecosystem scale chips to go with the "other side " group to negotiate . Platform World requires tripartite game perspective. </p>
						<p> This is the platform model most interesting places : Regardless of which side they are attached to expand the market size , the party market rights in raising their own words , but also gave a platform for enterprise more right to speak . So Smart Platform, Enterprise control of a market each hand , step by step to help their mutual stimulation, which enhance each other's right to speak. </p>
						<p> Focus Media in the early development of enterprises , a large number of office buildings into their territory within . One reason is that it is the same with many traditional advertising can not accurately measure exactly how much audience saw the ads, but they want to count the number of buildings is much simpler . When Focus Media swept enough buildings , forming a sufficient voice. </p>
						<p> Then , advertisers join, bringing cash flow growth , Focus Media to hire more buildings , supermarkets , continuing to include them among the eco- Sphere . At the same time , the development of these establishments also represents the third side market groups " advertising audience ," the scale of growth . Therefore , Focus even willing to rent several times higher than competitors tied firmly to the building , because " advertising spaces " rings of the scale is the core of the entire ecosystem . In order to consolidate the right to speak , advertisers in the face of Focus Media are out of the conditions , they often have to make concessions. Then, hold the hands of Focus Media to the huge list of advertisers as a bargaining chip , out of exclusivity clauses , laying the foundation and building contracting . </p>
						<p class="step"> Strategy intended to bind </p>
						<p> Business start-up period in the platform , subsidies policy is particularly important . At this pricing strategy is how to promote spindle users grows, sometimes must be free as an incentive . But if the number of critical success across the threshold , arrived maturity, pricing strategy must have changed. At this point, more important is to create diversified source of profits. If the user does not reach a certain size , diversity, massed pricing will unfeasible . </p>
						<p> Taobao business early , allowing buyers and sellers free stationed ecosystem, a few years to occupy the entire market. Charging mechanism , introduced in 2006 , " Good Fortune" ( let the seller bought a PPC keywords mechanisms ) but was user resistance , tens of thousands of shopkeepers joint " strike " situation. </p>
						<p> Taobao was the dilemma reflects platform ecosystem development phase transition in difficulty . The paradox is that its platform business strategy in order to free or subsidized offset the critical mass , this how to guide ecological circles groups accept payment terms . </p>
						<p> Later years , Taobao by observing their bilateral market response , and gradually dispersed channels to pay a small but diverse value-added services gradually construct profitable basis . </p>
						<p> The user to bind the platform ecosystem in the crux of users ' switching costs , "the amount . The so-called " switching costs " means when the user leaves the platform , users need to bear the loss. Network effects induced by various mechanisms conditions , and often the best tool to enhance the conversion costs . The reason is to prevent users from the platform of the most effective ways is to let them with other users to build a strong relationship between . </p>
						<p> Platform ecosystem is considered in a " side" of the market segments , most of the characteristics of openness . When the platform is heavily subsidized companies need a party users, to prevent the loss of any barriers they will become more important, otherwise the subsidy policy of the costs incurred will be for nothing ; Once the conversion platform is too simple , subsidies patterns are likely to lead to retain ecosystem inhabitants. </p>
						<p> Platform enterprise switching costs to enhance the user 's strategy there are considerable differences . Induce people to buy platform devices , and mechanisms to attract people betting time , provide incentives for people stationed ecosystem ...... these are only one of several ways . The most effective presence on the platform allows users to approach , in fact, the platform is to enable users to build eco- rings of the " identity of their own importance ." Giving people rights and choice, is to create the basis for a sense of belonging . People only realize that they can play on their environment and influence, it may be a sense of attachment to the environment . </p>
						<p class="step"> Which side of the first to promote the "market " growth ? </p>
						<p> Platform business models are facing the biggest challenge is how to start and continue network effect. Which side before locking the user growth will quickly decide whether the development of ecosystem occupy starting advantage. </p>
						<p> A platform for enterprises are facing two major strategic points to ponder : Which side should concentrate on growing populations make it grow ? What should we focus on serving their customer ? </p>
						<p> First , strategic measurement point may not have an established standard . But often before long, which party should focus on growing the market will quickly become clear this problem . Each competitor will usually have no choice but to adopt the same strategy , jointly compete for positioning on one side of the market as the core . </p>
						<p> Second question belongs subdivision location field. Platform to provide value to this exclusive focus groups as a strategic axis, while those who are eco- rings of the focus groups, mostly depending on the platform with the intention of corporate positioning the hands of resources ; This is the platform for the basis of differentiation . </p>
						<p> E-commerce , for example, to draw focus from the outset Taobao small businesses , self-employed seller for ecosystem to create a wide variety of product choices ; and Jingdong Mall will include a large-scale , or even a brand electronic products seller to guaranteed authentic, to ensure the quality of its core positioning . Therefore, although the two parties ecosystem caused due to the inevitable overlap competition , but their control of a relatively stable site . </p>
						<p class="step"> Ecosystem ductility </p>
						<p> To achieve " winner takes all " platform companies need to establish cross- border networks with the same side effects of the operation of the mechanism . However, there are still a crucial problem: how to ensure that the platform ecosystem has unlimited expansion scalability ? </p>
						<p> In traditional manufacturing industries , companies must try to supply chain management to reduce costs. Doing so would bring considerable competitive advantage as a traditional enterprise sales to customers established for each product represents the unit cost , the cost can be compressed parts , optimize production lines , distribution and control and so on. </p>
						<p> However, for platform businesses, ecosystem initial construction costs often account for a large proportion represented by each customer after the unit cost is negligible. Many have a strategy for traditional industries and therefore is no longer effective. </p>
						<p> So the only affordable to the average cost of the platform , and profitable way, is the growing number of users . This is why the scale of development and growth in the platform strategy is always the most important part . </p>
						<p> To marriage platform as an example , look ductility often determines who eventually will become the " winner takes all" overlord . </p>
						<p> 2008 , the cherished network with good margin century each with more than 20% share of market-leading , Lily network and other late- marriage platform followed. To the beginning of 2010 , the market share of Jiayuan exceeded 40%. Originally stalemate competition, almost in an instant was overturned. And we saw good margin century reached critical mass , by the second half of 2010 has been exclusively a market share of over 50% , to 30 million members ahead for industry leading position and achieve profitability . </p>
						<p> Many companies compete in the market situation , the entire industry competitive landscape to change in a very short period of time , if not there is something more powerful social force behind the drive is not likely to happen. Jiayuan time strategy mode in which all competitors , most have the potential to capture the powerful network effect . </p>
						<p> Jiayuan and diverse mechanisms have neutral system , manual intervention deliberately minimize the degree of mutual mate . Ecosystem by Members pricing , hobbies, exchanges and other segments conditions demand a variety of customers , so that they choose on the website . Layers of the face of cross- border network effect mechanism that can directly increase the number of members may be reproduced, each member of the obtained online services are the same. </p>
						<p> Contrast cherished network , its disadvantage is the "matchmaker " Team restrictions on the number itself . Team needs to meet stringent qualification requirements , so when tourists sudden , it is not readily available for every user the same quality of service . Rely on " human " pull strings , but far more than a " mechanism" to meet customer needs more quickly . Lily network model is summarized from scientific evaluation system matches the recommendation system, and hope to expert advisory services primarily to lock the high-end customer segment . However, even then the high-end customers do not necessarily want the pairing is successful and has been used consulting services. </p>
						<p> Here we need to emphasize : the differentiating features to enhance the user 's switching costs , although a " winner takes all" market conditions, but it is more in the ecosystem after they reach a certain scale work. Because the user leaves the ecosystem to prevent old barriers , many times also prevent new users into the ecosystem threshold. The industry has not yet reached saturation competitive situation , the platform when the scale elasticity strategy development an integral part . </p>
						<p> Finally, all enterprises should pay attention to new forms of " coverage" war eleven profit pool smashed the war. The enemy may have with your complementary adjacent industries, you may have a common alternative with overlapping industries may come from different dimensions of cross- industry, but also may come from unrelated industries. </p>
						<p> More appalling is that the most powerful part of the coverage are mostly polycyclic ecosystem, which is composed by numerous platforms empire . They can be implemented unimaginable subsidy policy to overturn your industry status quo. In order to cover those who face the threat , you can take and opponents commensurate strategic mode or try to distract your profit pool , or find a different industry companions who fight coverage . </p>
